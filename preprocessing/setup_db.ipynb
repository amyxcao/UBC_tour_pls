Sent to markets in Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea, India, the Middle East and even Africa, it inspired potters in major ceramic centres to produce elegant ceramics of their own design; from the rich turquoise fritwares of fifteenth-century Iznik, to elaborately panelled Japanese kraak wares from seventeenth century Arita. Blue-and-white porcelain was also the first to be collected in Europe in large numbers, sparking a craze for things Chinese in the sixteenth century that would last well into the nineteenth, as new generations of artists and collectors rediscovered and renewed the art form. The earliest surviving Chinese blue-and-white ceramics were made in the Tang period, when kilns in northern China dominated the production of both high-fired white stonewares and porcelains. A shared creation of China and the Islamic Middle East, they were decorated with cobalt blue imported from northeast Persia or the Arabian Peninsula, using decorative techniques invented by potters in Basra, Iraq to embellish tin-glazed earthenwares. These earthenwares were themselves developed in imitation of Chinese white wares, demonstrating the remarkable hybridity of early ceramic industries in Asia. Tang blue-and-white ceramics represented a brief period of experimentation that was not repeated until the fourteenth century, when strong familial, cultural and economic ties to the Islamic world and the stabilisation of overland trade routes under the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty opened new markets and made access to imported cobalt easier. Yuan imperial patronage turned the kilns of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province into the largest porcelain production centre in China. Combined with a cultural policy that promoted artistic exchange between different ethnic groups, this patronage created an atmosphere of experimentation that allowed new forms and styles to develop, including highly finished works intended for the court and less formal wares for the export market, transported along the silk road and from major ports like Canton and Quanzhou. The success of Yuan blue-and-whites laid the foundations for the dominance of the export industry in the Ming and Qing dynasties, when millions of ceramics were produced in the imperial kilns and private commercial enterprises. Tailored with specific designs for certain markets, they often found their way elsewhere. The Portuguese purchased blue-andwhite porcelain made for the Malay Peninsula in Malacca, and when the Dutch established a foothold in the Indonesian Archipelago in the first decades of the seventeenth century, they gained access to the important transhipment hub of Batavia ( Jakarta), from which over twelve million Chinese ceramics were shipped to Holland between 1607 and 1684. Not all of these were designed with European consumers in mind, and Dutch still-life oil paintings reveal that porcelains in shapes seemingly made for non-European customers were sold and used in Europe. Blue-and-white porcelain remained the most popular export form until the end of the seventeenth century, when growing European interest in wares decorated with coats of arms encouraged the use of polychrome enamels that allowed for more detailed, accurate depictions of heraldry. The Jingdezhen kilns, still the most important in China, responded to this demand and the trade in colourful porcelain supplanted blueand-white to become the defining aspect of Chinese export porcelain in the eighteenth century.'),\n",

Individual potter's marks are rare on Jingdezhen porcelain, but they occur much more frequently on porcelain from Dehua. Marks are usually found on the bottom of a piece, sometimes on the edge or shoulder, or in the centre. Many different marks can be found on Chinese porcelain. The most prevalent in this catalogue are imperial marks that occur on pieces for the court and related institutions from the Ming dynasty onwards. They usually consist of six characters (sometimes four) in two rows that are read from right to left and from top to bottom, or in seal script within a square. The first two characters indicate the dynasty (for instance Da Ming, ‘the great Ming dynasty’). The next two give the reign name (nian hao) of the ruling emperor, for instance Jiajing, or Wanli. The last two characters mean ‘made during the period of ’ (nian zhi). This tradition was continued during the Qing dynasty. Imperial Ming and Qing marks also occur on non–imperial wares and even on export porcelain. The early modern era was marked by the extension of the Silk Road to Italy and by the beginning of the importation into Europe of Eastern goods in the fourteenth century. Porcelain from China—the first country in the world to produce highfired, glazed ceramics—was one of the most important elements of this trade, which in the sixteenth century had expanded to include vast quantities of tea, silk, lacquer, spices and opium. This catalogue and its accompanying exhibition tell the story of this trade, exploring how ceramics from different regions, particularly China and Europe, spread styles, forms and manufacturing technologies across the globe, and in the process dramatically altered the course of European and Asian art. While we place particular importance on early Ming dynasty blue-and-white porcelain pieces that reached the Ducal court of the Medicis in Florence, and early export goods in the Low Countries, our chronological display begins much earlier, with a rare Tang dynasty blue-and-white water pot and a Yuan dynasty bottle—both from time periods that predate betterknown Ming production. These ceramics highlight the artistic quality and beauty of Chinese wares, as well as their influence, appreciation and imitation abroad. This international theme is further explored by presenting Ming and Qing dynasty objects that were made for local consumption in China, as well as for export alongside local responses to these wares in Europe, East Asia and Southeast Asia. In so doing, we move beyond the better-known influences of export to the West by including regional varieties of, for example, celadon ware in Korea and Thailand. We would like to thank our exhibition partners, the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Hong Kong Maritime Museum for their generous loans, and for their assistance in organising related public programming and publications. As with all UMAG exhibitions, our mission is to engage with audiences through the discussion of materials and techniques, as well as historic and cross-cultural exchanges.

During the late Ming and Qing dynasties, when the trade in porcelain between China and the West reached new heights, porcelains decorated in red, green and yellow with outlines of blackish cobalt or underglaze blue called wucai (‘five-colour’) became the most widely produced polychrome wares. Depending on the prominence of certain colours, they came to be known in Europe by names such as famille verte (‘green family’) and famille rose (‘rose family’), after terms used\\xa0by the French Jesuit and\\xa0ceramic\\xa0collector Albert\\xa0Jacquemart\\xa0in 1873. Colours were added to porcelain by applying enamels (powdered glass mixed with pigments) to unglazed clay that had been through one firing or to glazed ceramics, sometimes with underglaze decoration in blue applied beforehand. The enamels were then fused to the surface through a second firing at a relatively low temperature of about $900^{\\\\circ}\\\\mathrm{C}$ . Major advancements in the production of polychrome porcelain were achieved in the early eighteenth century, driven by the support of the Kangxi emperor—a patron of the arts who encouraged experimentation at the imperial kilns in Jingdezhen—and by the arrival of European Jesuits at court, who brought with them knowledge of Western chemistry. These innovations included the use of a greater percentage of kaolin in the firing process, the subtle use of shading in new colours like pink and white, and changes to the composition and firing of glazes that led to the invention of complex hues like ‘peachbloom’ and ‘oxblood red’. Enamelled porcelain proved hugely successful in Europe, and large amounts were purchased by the Dutch and British East India companies in the seventeenth century. This trade was briefly interrupted when the Qing dynasty cut off porcelain exports from 1644 to 1684, at which point traders turned to the Arita kilns in Japan. The brightly coloured objects they purchased from there were popular enough that Chinese makers were forced to imitate Japanese styles when Chinese exports resumed. European manufactories later produced their own synthesised versions, incorporating stylistic features found on export ceramics from both countries. Facing strong competition from China and Japan, they developed a wide range of goods aimed at different classes, from fine ornamental pieces for the fashion-conscious, to simply decorated items for daily use. Enamelled porcelain tended to be more expensive than blueand-white porcelain, which could be produced in a single firing, and also tended to be more expensive. It was seen as particularly suitable for special commissions with personalised decoration, such as coats of arms, and could replicate designs better than blue-and-white porcelain. It was an interest in these armorial porcelains that drove much of the demand for enamelled porcelains in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Many different types of enamelled porcelain were also produced for export to parts of Asia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, where colourful and boldly patterned ceramics like Zhangzhou ware had been traded since the late Ming dynasty. Some were decorated with unique palettes and motifs not found on ceramics for other markets, such as the vividly contrasting colours and Hindu-Buddhist iconography of ‘Bencharong’ (derived from the Sanskrit word for ‘fivecolour’)  for the Siamese court, or the auspicious symbolism and bright pinks, greens and yellows of ‘nyonya ware’ made for Peranakan Chinese communities in the Straits Settlements.'),\n",

Delicate, nearly transparent and resistant to extreme heat and moisture, they were technologically superior to the thick, low-fired European ceramics made before the eighteenth century, and were regarded as objects of great rarity and luxury. Their construction was so poorly understood that European collectors often had them mounted in gilt silver or gold in a manner similar to naturalia (‘natural wonders’) like ostrich eggs and large shells, which emphasised their preciousness and transformed them into entirely different objects. They were often displayed in cabinets of curiosities: collections of extraordinary objects which, like today's museums, attempted to categorise and tell stories about the wonders of the natural world (fig. 2). By the early sixteenth century—after Portugal established trade routes to the Far East and began commercial trade with Asia via Portuguese-controlled ports in Macau, Malacca and Dejima—porcelain became an important component of the wider trade in silk, spices, tea, ivory, metalwork and lacquer between East and West. Major production centres like Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province responded to demand in Europe by producing large amounts of porcelain specifically for export, transported and used as a form of ballast in large merchant ships. New arrivals like the Dutch and British built The word porcelain originated with the Venetian traveller Marco Polo (1254–1324) when he saw white-bodied ceramics being made in China for the court of Kublai Khan. He called them porcelanna, Italian for a white seashell, and this soon became the standard term in Europe. But China had been producing porcelain of the highest quality for markets across the globe long before the arrival of Europeans. From the sixth to twentieth centuries, Chinese kilns produced everything from magnificent display pieces for the imperial court to vast quantities of bowls, plates and dishes intended for everyday use and for export to Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea and the Islamic world. The appeal of these works lay not just in their technical achievement, but also in their association with Chinese art and culture, long viewed as a source of learning, tradition and vast wealth.

The fashion for collecting these objects spread so quickly as to appear almost contagious, and was described by some enthusiasts as la maladie die porcelaine— ‘porcelain-sickness’. Among the wealthiest collectors this led to the creation of ‘porcelain rooms’, where masses of porcelain wares were displayed together and arranged on mantelpieces, cabinets and fitted wall-mounts—part of the late Baroque interior which combined the lavish use of colour with wood panelled or lacquered walls. Jug with Portuguese arms. Jingdezhen, China, ca. 1520–1540. Porcelain with underglaze blue, height 18.7 cm. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York 1. Architect and designer Daniel Marot (1661–1752) is often linked to this late Baroque style. His designs for several rooms of Kensington Palace demonstrate the typical high-density approach to porcelain display of the late Baroque period (ca. 1660–1725). The appearance of these objects changed in step with tastes in Europe. At times consumers favoured designs that depicted an exotic East, while at others Western patterns with prominent armorial crests or landscapes and figures taken from prints were preferred. European designs were transmitted via a wellestablished trading network which carried models to China, where they were copied onto special services (fig. 3). This often had strange results, such as a Dutch charger with the arms of Amsterdam inscribed ‘AMSTEL DAM’ or a porcelain ewer with the seal of Portugal painted upside down (fig. 4). Europeans also affected artistic change by bringing new technologies and techniques to China, such as the famille-rose (‘rose family’ in French) palette, which was employed widely on both domestic and export porcelain. Guiseppe Castiglione (1688–1766), a Jesuit painter patronised by the Kangxi, Yongzheng and Qianlong emperors, famously introduced Western painting techniques such as single-point perspective to Chinese artists, which found expression across a variety of mediums. Like all successful inventions, Chinese ceramics inspiredcompetition, at first in Asia and later in Europe. In the lateTang period, traders from the Middle East brought Chineseporcelains to western Asia, where potters in Iraq copied themas la maladie die porcelaine)。 3. The Dutch, exempt from restrictions on trade placed on other European nations by the Japanese authorities, also exposed the Arita potters to Chinese underglaze blue porcelain, which was popular in Europe, so that they could use it as an example in their own work. 4. Some scholars have suggested that English manufacturers may have produced hard-paste porcelain before Böttger, but his factory in Meissen was certainly the first to produce it in large quantities (Queiroz and Agathopoulos 2005).\"),\n",

This decreased to $5\\\\%$ from 1424–1430 to 1487, before rebounding during the reign of the Hongzhi emperor, and then declining once again until the formal rescinding of the haijin (‘sea ban’) in 1567. with great ingenuity. Lacking access to naturally occurring kaolin clay—a mineral rich in silicates that gives porcelain much of its strength—they emulated the beauty of pure white porcelain using white slip (a liquefied suspension of clay particles in water), often embellished with painted decoration in blue pigments derived from cobalt oxide (fig. 5). Following the introduction of Chinese examples towards the end of the Tran dynasty (1225–1400), Vietnamese potters developed their own unique ceramics, which were more heavily potted than Chinese wares and slightly off-white in colour (fig. 6). Produced at major kiln sites like Chu Dou and Bát Tràng near Hanoi, these wares benefited from the first of several interruptions to porcelain production in China, brought about by social unrest and dynastic change, and by the fifteenth century formed part of a lively intra-Asian trade in ceramics with Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. On China’s borders, nearly five centuries of Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) rule in Korea saw blue-green celadons inspired by wares from China become the dominant type of ceramics produced on the peninsula. And Korean potters, many of whom arrived during two invasions of Korea led by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the 1590s, took an active role in the development of porcelain production in Japan. The early porcelain wares they produced, called Imari after a port near kilns in Arita, had a coarse, grainy texture with fluid, free-form designs in various shades of blue. They were influenced by both Korean and Chinese monochrome porcelain and less formal blue-andwhite wares from southern Chinese kilns—the latter export wares that were made to conform to the aesthetic of the Japanese tea ceremony. Later Imari wares were consciously designed to cater to Western tastes and became much more colourful and regimented, at times achieving more access in Europe than their Chinese counterparts. Augustus II the Strong of Saxony (who on his death in 1733 owned 35,798 pieces of porcelain; the largest collection in Europe), Böttger established a factory at Meissen, just outside Dresden, in 1710, and was soon producing large amounts of hard-paste porcelain. In the 1720s, the Meissen factory developed a new and extensive range of enamel colours, and the factory’s painters excelled in fantastic depictions of life in an imagined Far East. These successes were soon followed by the founding of a second factory in Vienna by Claudius du Paquier, assisted by the former kiln master from Meissen, which began making hard-paste porcelain by about 1719. A number of other factories opened in Germany in the 1740s and ’50s, often with workers from Meissen or Vienna who provided the necessary technical expertise. The discoveries in Meissen were followed by the establishment of major factories elsewhere in Europe. In Italy, where softpaste porcelain (an imitation, low-fired porcelain that lacked the ingredients found in hard-paste porcelain) had been made at the Medici workshops since the late sixteenth century, Francesco Vezzi established a porcelain factory in Venice that began producing hard-paste porcelain in significant numbers in 1720. Experiments by the Marchese Carlo Ginori led to the development of a hard-paste porcelain factory in Doccia, near Florence in 1737, which produced works inspired by delicate white wares from Dehua (fig. 7). Both men were assisted by workers from the Du Paquier factory, and Doccia porcelain from the 1740s sometimes features painted decoration that reflects the influence of Du Paquier porcelain—demonstrating the atmosphere of technological and stylistic exchange that characterised the European ceramic industry of the eighteenth century. of the eighteenth century. Innovative and experimental new forms were always in development, and the factory looked to different sources of inspiration, such as Japanese lacquer (fig. 8). By the mid-1750s, it had overtaken the Meissen factory in terms of production and innovation. It remained at the forefront of European porcelain production for the rest of the century. Across the channel, English manufacturers struggled to discover the secrets of making porcelain without access to the necessary ingredients, and between the 1740s and 1760s were only able to develop formulae that created a range of soft-paste porcelains unsuitable for tableware. This changed after the discovery of kaolin clay in Cornwall in 1746 by an English chemist named William Cookworthy, who soon found even better-quality clay in St Stephen’s, near St Austell. After two decades of experimentation, Cookworthy patented his recipe for making porcelain and established the Plymouth China factory in 1768—the first in England to manufacture hard-paste porcelain. By the turn of the century, England had a flourishing porcelain industry, with factories in Derby, Worcester, Staffordshire, Liverpool and elsewhere. Primarily commercial ventures that operated without noble or royal financial support, they were run by entrepreneurs and artisans, and much of their output was aimed at a growing middle class. The European factories were so successful that eventually the demand for Chinese porcelain began to diminish, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the trade fell into serious decline. But centuries of genuine artistic exchange stimulated by the trade in porcelain had left an indelible mark on the arts of Europe. Chinese ceramics remain a potent source of design ideas for artists today, working in fields as diverse as architecture, interior design, theatre and painting. Ben Chiesa   \\nAssistant Curator, University Museum and Art Gallery,   \\nThe University of Hong Kong Kaolin was not discovered in France until the second half of the eighteenth century, and all French porcelain produced before 1770 was soft- rather than hard-paste. Both types were first made in factories which had previously produced the most common ceramic product of the time—faience, a type of tin-glazed earthenware—like those in Rouen and SaintCloud. Perhaps the most successful of these was at Sèvres in the western part of Paris, which had moved from its former premises in Vincennes in 1756. With the financial backing of King Louis XV (r. 1715–1774), the Sèvres factory soon came to dominate not only the French ceramic industry, but also the entirety of European ceramics for the second half Plate.

He observed that they were one of the main wares manufactured for the Qing court on a regular basis, and a recent invention—though the long history of brown glazes in China suggests that he was referring specifically to technical processes used in the early eighteenth century rather than brown-glazed porcelain in general. These wares were particularly popular in the Netherlands, although significant quantities recovered from the foundered Swedish East Indiaman Gotheborg (sunk 1745) demonstrate that they were also exported to Northern Europe in large quantities. They were shipped to America after it entered the China trade in 1784, and the decoration was later revived in the early nineteenth century, primarily on wares intended for export to Southeast Asia.

Alongside a reign mark attributing its production to the forty-first year of the Qianlong emperor’s reign, a carved inscription on the foot identifies its subject as cong wuyi Ruren— the wife of an imperial official. The rest of the text provides her name, Zou, and nickname (Jugu, ‘lady of chrysanthemum’) from which the dish presumably takes its shape. This is followed by a detailed account of her family background. Ruren was the title granted for the mothers and wives of imperial officials of the seventh rank and higher during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Traditional epitaphs were often carved on stones or ceramics. They described the experiences, merits and accomplishments of the deceased and were mostly reserved for imperial officials and their family members. The eulogy on this bowl associates Zou with many of the feminine virtues in dynastic China, such as the Confucian triad of obedience as a daughter, wife and mother. Both ‘willow’ and ‘stay’ are pronounced liu in Chinese, and the presence of the willow at the centre of the bowl was likely an expression of yearning for Zou from her family. mathrm{~X~}~27$ HKU.C.1991.0939 The extremely fine, evenly toned porcelains in this section were made in the kilns of Dehua in Fujian province, southern China. Fujian, a tea-growing region, attracted the attention of European merchants in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and many of these objects were brought back to Europe, where this type of white Dehua porcelain became known as blanc de Chine (French for ‘white of China’). They were also exported to Japan in large quantities. Dehua specialised in whitewares, the most highly prized were those with an ivory-coloured glaze. References in seventeenthcentury literary sources note that the translucent appearance of Dehua whitewares was the result of ‘truly fine’ porcelain stone that was dug by driving a shaft into the side of a nearby hill, from where the material was then pulled out with a rope. The earliest pieces of Dehua porcelain were made of this locally mined porcelain stone, with little or no clay, and were thinly potted. Unlike Jingdezhen, the Dehua kilns had no access to water transportation and until the arrival of foreign merchants most of its products were sold locally. The most common types of Dehua products were incense burners and Buddhist figures moulded and finished by hand. In China, these were usually placed on household altars and the latter were worshipped as devotional images. They were also brought to Europe as exotic curiosity items during the seventeenth century, where they were placed on tables and cabinets in the residences of aristocrats and wealthy people, or exhibited in ‘porcelain rooms’. By the eighteenth century, Europeans were familiar with Chinese polychrome ceramics. Dehua wares simply may have been seen as too plain by comparison, and many were gilded or enamelled in Europe to make them more attractive to customers. The Dehua kilns also produced objects tailored for the European market, including figures of Dutch men and women and Christian figures. These wares were closely copied at European porcelain factories, such as Meissen, Chantilly and Bow.'),\n",

Guanyin, the bodhisattva of compassion, is one of the most popular Buddhist figures in China. She originated in India as the male bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, who was transformed after the introduction of Buddhism into China (through a process that is not well understood) into a female bodhisattva associated with the virtues of compassion and mercy. Guanyin was also worshipped as the patron of fishermen, and by women as a fertility goddess and ‘bringer of sons’. Early images of a cowled female bodhisattva, dating from the Song dynasty, have been found at the ancient Buddhist cave shrines of Maijishan (cave 165), Gansu province and Dazu (cave 136) in Chongqing. From the seventeenth century onwards, the porcelain kilns at Dehua were celebrated for their production of Buddhist models, amongst which Guanyin figures were prominent.

The text displays the poem A Visit to the Red Cliffs at Night by the Ming dynasty official Luo Hongxian, (1504–1564). A cartographer and scholar, Luo’s interest in topography and the Chinese landscape is well expressed in his poem, which was written in response to the Ode to the Red Cliffs by the Northern Song scholar Su Shi (1037–1101). Luo wrote that he visited the Red Cliffs five hundred years after Su Shi, and that the scenery was as beautiful as it was in the past. He described his attempts to retrace Su Shi’s footsteps, and the sight of fishermen who came to sell fish in a silent landscape with lonely cranes flying above a river.

The powder blue porcelain vessels have an elegant, undulating profile. The elaborate gilded bronze mounts, which show dragons, were finely sculpted, cast and gilded in France, likely during the reign of Louis XV (1710–1774). Imported wares were often mounted with extravagant gilt-bronze settings, which adopted the stylistic vocabulary and fantastic forms of French rococo, while also making unfamiliar Chinese forms more useable in European interiors. Merchants called marchands-merciers, who specialised in marketing luxury objects, facilitated the addition of such mounts to porcelain, drawing on extensive networks of silversmiths, craftsmen and decorators. This pair of vessels demonstrates the high regard for fine Chinese porcelain at the European courts. In France, the earliest recorded Chinese (blue-and-white) ceramic object reached the court of Henry II (1519–1559) via Constantinople, a gift from Suleiman the Magnificent (1494–1566), Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Further gifts presented by the Siamese ambassador Phra Narai (1633– 1688) to Louis XIV (1638–1715) in 1686, and objects imported by the French East India Company (since 1664) helped spread a fashion for such exotica. The intense blue of these Chinese jars may well have been an inspiration for the Sevres blue for which the French royal manufactory became so famous later in the eighteenth century.'),\n",

After use, they were rinsed and stored in the pot with their handle down so that the bundles of hair would keep their shape.

The literati valued beauty inspired by nature, a preference vividly reflected in the objects they displayed in their studios, whether in the choice of shapes, materials or decorative themes. Literati objects like brush pots occasionally made their way into European collections via other markets. They were often repurposed, and it was not unusual to find brush pots in Europe being used as flowerpots.

The name was first used by collectors in New York, Boston and Philadelphia in the 1930s to refer to their ostentatious detail and subject matter. Late export porcelain of this type was typically made, glazed and fired at Jingdezhen but decorated in Canton, from where it was shipped to Europe and America. These custard cups are part of a larger dinner service of dishes, plates, saucers, platters, tureens, bowls and cups suitable for a grand interior. Each object is decorated with a central scene in the famille rose palette showing different men and women among pavilions and mountainous landscapes. The scenes are surrounded by several painted and gilded borders with geometric and floral patterns, interrupted by small panels showing birds, flowers and landscapes in iron-red or sepia. This design has been referred to as the ‘Rockefeller pattern’ since 1979, due to its association with the famous Rockefeller family of New York. John D. Rockefeller, Jr (1874–1960), son and heir of the dynasty's founder, owned a dessert service with the pattern. Prior to being acquired by the Rockefellers, the service was owned and probably commissioned by Charles Stirling, a wealthy Scottish landowner involved in the China trade. Another service of the same design is known to have been ordered by John Roberts (1739–1810), a Director of the British East India Company, likely around 1805. The gradual dissemination of these services through inheritance and sale accounts for the presence of many individual pieces in different collections today. The famille rose palette used to paint the central scenes was developed in China during the late Kangxi period by Jesuit priests working with craftsmen at the Yangxindian (‘Hall of Mental Cultivation’) within the Forbidden City. It is characterised by soft pinks and reds created by mixing ruby red (derived from colloidal gold) and opaque white enamel, which allowed for a great range of tones and shading. Its development in China was roughly contemporaneous with rose du barry enamels invented in France in the eighteenth century, named after the Comtesse du Barry, mistress to Louis XV (1710–1774) and a patron of the Sèvres porcelain factory.\")]"

In the West, the term porcelain refers specifically to white ceramics made with a special type of clay called kaolin and fired to a temperature of about $1300^{\\\\circ}\\\\mathrm{C}$ , which results in a translucent, glassy material that makes a ringing sound when struck. Stoneware is used to refer to related ceramics that are similarly hard and dense, but which are made with grey or brown clay, may or may not be white-bodied, do not transmit light, and are fired to a slightly lower temperature of 1000 to $1250^{\\\\circ}\\\\mathrm{C}$ . Ceramics fired below this temperature range are called earthenwares. The terms ‘protoporcelain’ or ‘porcellaneous’ are sometimes used to describe early ceramics made with some of the same ingredients and physical characteristics of porcelain.')]"
