       "  'text': 'This immense ceramic is a jardinière, made as a decorative display or water container for the gardens of a Chinese villa. The main pattern depicts awkward-looking twin lions with sharp claws playing with ornamental balls. A prominent inscription at the centre reads: Da Ming Jiajing Nian Zhi— ‘Manufactured in the Reign of Jiajing of the Great Ming Dynasty’. Because of their weight, large objects like this were particularly difficult to manufacture, often warping during the firing process. By some accounts, they required up to nine days to fire, with frequent misfires. The almost purple colour of the decoration is the result of mixing imported cobalt blue with local cobalt from Ruizhou, called shiziqing. A signature colour of Jiajing porcelains, it was generally only used on jardinières reserved for the imperial court, noble families or high-ranking officials. Auspicious patterns like the twin lions sporting ornamental balls were popular during the reign of the Jiajing emperor, a result of his interest in Daoism, alchemy and Xiangrui (‘auspicious signs’). The rest of the designs on the jardinière are similarly loaded with symbolism: the cloud motifs are variations of the ruyi (‘wish-granting wand’) design. The grouping of these images represents a common device in Chinese art: the use of homophones to create visual puns. For example, the words for ‘lion’ and ‘things’ are both pronounced shi in Chinese. The combination of twin lions and cloud patterns therefore refers to the blessing of shishi ruyi (‘wishes for all things will be granted’). Europeans who acquired Chinese porcelain likely had little understanding of this complex visual language, but enjoyed the pleasing colour, exotic subject matter, minute detail and technical achievement of such objects. The unusual creatures and unfamiliar landscapes also undoubtedly contributed to a European vision of the East that found expression in fantastical art movements such as Chinoiserie and Japonisme.

Oversized examples with extremely fine painting also had an additional ornamental function, and were occasionally used to decorate imperial palace grounds. They were popular export items to the Middle East and Southeast Asia in the fourteenth century, with comparable jars preserved in the Ardabil Shrine, Iran, and Wat Mahathat, a temple in Lamphun, Thailand. An inscription at the centre locates the production of this jar to Jingdezhen in the 24th year of the reign of the Jiajing emperor (1545)—although similar jars were imitated well into the nineteenth century. Blue-and-white guan jars evolved significantly over the course of the Yuan and Ming dynasties. The neck of this guan is significantly wider than most fourteenth-century examples, which also had lower shoulders, sometimes with small handles attached. The banded floral decoration is typical of the mid-Ming period, although vessels painted with peacocks—a symbol of beauty, power and the Ming court—are more unusual.

Popular throughout the Ming and Qing dynasties, this pair was made during the reign of the Jiajing emperor. In keeping with the emperor's interest in auspicious symbolism, the three goats and suns surrounded by prunus, pine and bamboo trees are another example of the use of homophones in the Chinese language to create visual puns. The goats and suns (both pronounced yang) form a rebus that refers to a passage from the I Ching (‘The Book of Changes’): “the first month of the year is the Trigram of Tai, after which three suns rise”. The passage denotes the passing of seasons as winter (associated with the cosmic force of yin) ends and spring (associated with yang) arrives, and carries an auspicious message of renewal.\"},\n",

The earliest enamelled porcelains with ducks and lotus flowers alternating in a row on the exterior appear to date to the Jiajing period, such as an iron-red, green and yellow bowl from the British Museum illustrated in Harrison-Hall 2001, no. 9:101. This plate depicts a red five-clawed dragon writhing in mid-air above blue swirling waves. The colour combination was achieved by painting waves in cobalt oxide under a clear glaze and firing the clay at a high temperature. Red enamels were applied later and fused on in a subsequent, low-temperature firing. Dragons against breaking waves were popular designs from the Ming dynasty onward, and underglaze-blue and red examples can be found with reign marks of nearly all the Qing emperors.

       "  'text': 'This immense ceramic is a jardinière, made as a decorative display or water container for the gardens of a Chinese villa. The main pattern depicts awkward-looking twin lions with sharp claws playing with ornamental balls. A prominent inscription at the centre reads: Da Ming Jiajing Nian Zhi— ‘Manufactured in the Reign of Jiajing of the Great Ming Dynasty’. Because of their weight, large objects like this were particularly difficult to manufacture, often warping during the firing process. By some accounts, they required up to nine days to fire, with frequent misfires. The almost purple colour of the decoration is the result of mixing imported cobalt blue with local cobalt from Ruizhou, called shiziqing. A signature colour of Jiajing porcelains, it was generally only used on jardinières reserved for the imperial court, noble families or high-ranking officials. Auspicious patterns like the twin lions sporting ornamental balls were popular during the reign of the Jiajing emperor, a result of his interest in Daoism, alchemy and Xiangrui (‘auspicious signs’). The rest of the designs on the jardinière are similarly loaded with symbolism: the cloud motifs are variations of the ruyi (‘wish-granting wand’) design. The grouping of these images represents a common device in Chinese art: the use of homophones to create visual puns. For example, the words for ‘lion’ and ‘things’ are both pronounced shi in Chinese. The combination of twin lions and cloud patterns therefore refers to the blessing of shishi ruyi (‘wishes for all things will be granted’). Europeans who acquired Chinese porcelain likely had little understanding of this complex visual language, but enjoyed the pleasing colour, exotic subject matter, minute detail and technical achievement of such objects. The unusual creatures and unfamiliar landscapes also undoubtedly contributed to a European vision of the East that found expression in fantastical art movements such as Chinoiserie and Japonisme.
