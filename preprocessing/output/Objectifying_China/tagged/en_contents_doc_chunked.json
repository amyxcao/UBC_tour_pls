Stoneware is used to refer to related ceramics that are similarly hard and dense, but which are made with grey or brown clay, may or may not be white-bodied, do not transmit light, and are fired to a slightly lower temperature of 1000 to $1250^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . Ceramics fired below this temperature range are called earthenwares.

        "text": "Other character marks and seal marks may have many different meanings: a wish for good luck, a date, a quality comparison, an owner or factory, or an indication for use in a specific setting. Individual potter's marks are rare on Jingdezhen porcelain, but they occur much more frequently on porcelain from Dehua. Marks are usually found on the bottom of a piece, sometimes on the edge or shoulder, or in the centre. Many different marks can be found on Chinese porcelain. The most prevalent in this catalogue are imperial marks that occur on pieces for the court and related institutions from the Ming dynasty onwards. They usually consist of six characters (sometimes four) in two rows that are read from right to left and from top to bottom, or in seal script within a square. The first two characters indicate the dynasty (for instance Da Ming, \u2018the great Ming dynasty\u2019). The next two give the reign name (nian hao) of the ruling emperor, for instance Jiajing, or Wanli. The last two characters mean \u2018made during the period of \u2019 (nian zhi). This tradition was continued during the Qing dynasty. Imperial Ming and Qing marks also occur on non\u2013imperial wares and even on export porcelain. The early modern era was marked by the extension of the Silk Road to Italy and by the beginning of the importation into Europe of Eastern goods in the fourteenth century. Porcelain from China\u2014the first country in the world to produce highfired, glazed ceramics\u2014was one of the most important elements of this trade, which in the sixteenth century had expanded to include vast quantities of tea, silk, lacquer, spices and opium. This catalogue and its accompanying exhibition tell the story of this trade, exploring how ceramics from different regions, particularly China and Europe, spread styles, forms and manufacturing technologies across the globe, and in the process dramatically altered the course of European and Asian art. While we place particular importance on early Ming dynasty blue-and-white porcelain pieces that reached the Ducal court of the Medicis in Florence, and early export goods in the Low Countries, our chronological display begins much earlier, with a rare Tang dynasty blue-and-white water pot and a Yuan dynasty bottle\u2014both from time periods that predate betterknown Ming production. These ceramics highlight the artistic quality and beauty of Chinese wares, as well as their influence, appreciation and imitation abroad. This international theme is further explored by presenting Ming and Qing dynasty objects that were made for local consumption in China, as well as for export alongside local responses to these wares in Europe, East Asia and Southeast Asia. In so doing, we move beyond the better-known influences of export to the West by including regional varieties of, for example, celadon ware in Korea and Thailand. We would like to thank our exhibition partners, the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Hong Kong Maritime Museum for their generous loans, and for their assistance in organising related public programming and publications. As with all UMAG exhibitions, our mission is to engage with audiences through the discussion of materials and techniques, as well as historic and cross-cultural exchanges. We express our gratitude to Robert Black College, The University of Hong Kong, for support of the exhibition on their 50th anniversary.

        "text": "The first Chinese porcelains arrived in Europe in the fourteenth century, when small numbers were presented as rare gifts to the ruling houses of Europe via intermediaries in the Middle East (fig. 1). Delicate, nearly transparent and resistant to extreme heat and moisture, they were technologically superior to the thick, low-fired European ceramics made before the eighteenth century, and were regarded as objects of great rarity and luxury. Their construction was so poorly understood that European collectors often had them mounted in gilt silver or gold in a manner similar to naturalia (\u2018natural wonders\u2019) like ostrich eggs and large shells, which emphasised their preciousness and transformed them into entirely different objects. They were often displayed in cabinets of curiosities: collections of extraordinary objects which, like today's museums, attempted to categorise and tell stories about the wonders of the natural world (fig. 2). By the early sixteenth century\u2014after Portugal established trade routes to the Far East and began commercial trade with Asia via Portuguese-controlled ports in Macau, Malacca and Dejima\u2014porcelain became an important component of the wider trade in silk, spices, tea, ivory, metalwork and lacquer between East and West. Major production centres like Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province responded to demand in Europe by producing large amounts of porcelain specifically for export, transported and used as a form of ballast in large merchant ships. New arrivals like the Dutch and British built The word porcelain originated with the Venetian traveller Marco Polo (1254\u20131324) when he saw white-bodied ceramics being made in China for the court of Kublai Khan. He called them porcelanna, Italian for a white seashell, and this soon became the standard term in Europe. But China had been producing porcelain of the highest quality for markets across the globe long before the arrival of Europeans. From the sixth to twentieth centuries, Chinese kilns produced everything from magnificent display pieces for the imperial court to vast quantities of bowls, plates and dishes intended for everyday use and for export to Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea and the Islamic world. The appeal of these works lay not just in their technical achievement, but also in their association with Chinese art and culture, long viewed as a source of learning, tradition and vast wealth.

The fashion for collecting these objects spread so quickly as to appear almost contagious, and was described by some enthusiasts as la maladie die porcelaine\u2014 \u2018porcelain-sickness\u2019. Among the wealthiest collectors this led to the creation of \u2018porcelain rooms\u2019, where masses of porcelain wares were displayed together and arranged on mantelpieces, cabinets and fitted wall-mounts\u2014part of the late Baroque interior which combined the lavish use of colour with wood panelled or lacquered walls. Jug with Portuguese arms. Jingdezhen, China, ca. 1520\u20131540. Porcelain with underglaze blue, height 18.7 cm. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York 1. Architect and designer Daniel Marot (1661\u20131752) is often linked to this late Baroque style. His designs for several rooms of Kensington Palace demonstrate the typical high-density approach to porcelain display of the late Baroque period (ca. 1660\u20131725). The appearance of these objects changed in step with tastes in Europe. At times consumers favoured designs that depicted an exotic East, while at others Western patterns with prominent armorial crests or landscapes and figures taken from prints were preferred. European designs were transmitted via a wellestablished trading network which carried models to China, where they were copied onto special services (fig. 3). This often had strange results, such as a Dutch charger with the arms of Amsterdam inscribed \u2018AMSTEL DAM\u2019 or a porcelain ewer with the seal of Portugal painted upside down (fig. 4). Europeans also affected artistic change by bringing new technologies and techniques to China, such as the famille-rose (\u2018rose family\u2019 in French) palette, which was employed widely on both domestic and export porcelain. Guiseppe Castiglione (1688\u20131766), a Jesuit painter patronised by the Kangxi, Yongzheng and Qianlong emperors, famously introduced Western painting techniques such as single-point perspective to Chinese artists, which found expression across a variety of mediums. Like all successful inventions, Chinese ceramics inspiredcompetition, at first in Asia and later in Europe. In the lateTang period, traders from the Middle East brought Chineseporcelains to western Asia, where potters in Iraq copied themas la maladie die porcelaine)\u3002 3. The Dutch, exempt from restrictions on trade placed on other European nations by the Japanese authorities, also exposed the Arita potters to Chinese underglaze blue porcelain, which was popular in Europe, so that they could use it as an example in their own work. 4. Some scholars have suggested that English manufacturers may have produced hard-paste porcelain before B\u00f6ttger, but his factory in Meissen was certainly the first to produce it in large quantities (Queiroz and Agathopoulos 2005).",

        "text": "Portuguese traders were successful in returning home with samples of kaolin, which they discovered in China to be essential in the production of porcelain wares, but Europeans remained ignorant of the techniques and processes involved in the production of porcelain until 1708, when the first European hard-paste porcelain (made from a compound of the feldspathic rock petuntse and kaolin clay fired at around $1400^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{)}$ was made in Meissen, Germany by Johann Friedrich B\u00f6ttger. With support from the porcelain-obsessed 2. Referred to as the \u2018Ming gap\u2019 (ca. 1370\u2013 1570) by scholars like Roxanna Brown, these interruptions occurred between 1325 and 1380. The second severe shortage of blue-and-white porcelain saw China\u2019s market share of ceramic production decrease to $50\\%$ from 1368 to 1424\u20131430. This decreased to $5\\%$ from 1424\u20131430 to 1487, before rebounding during the reign of the Hongzhi emperor, and then declining once again until the formal rescinding of the haijin (\u2018sea ban\u2019) in 1567. with great ingenuity. Lacking access to naturally occurring kaolin clay\u2014a mineral rich in silicates that gives porcelain much of its strength\u2014they emulated the beauty of pure white porcelain using white slip (a liquefied suspension of clay particles in water), often embellished with painted decoration in blue pigments derived from cobalt oxide (fig. 5). Following the introduction of Chinese examples towards the end of the Tran dynasty (1225\u20131400), Vietnamese potters developed their own unique ceramics, which were more heavily potted than Chinese wares and slightly off-white in colour (fig. 6). Produced at major kiln sites like Chu Dou and B\u00e1t Tr\u00e0ng near Hanoi, these wares benefited from the first of several interruptions to porcelain production in China, brought about by social unrest and dynastic change, and by the fifteenth century formed part of a lively intra-Asian trade in ceramics with Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. On China\u2019s borders, nearly five centuries of Goryeo dynasty (918\u20131392) rule in Korea saw blue-green celadons inspired by wares from China become the dominant type of ceramics produced on the peninsula. And Korean potters, many of whom arrived during two invasions of Korea led by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the 1590s, took an active role in the development of porcelain production in Japan. The early porcelain wares they produced, called Imari after a port near kilns in Arita, had a coarse, grainy texture with fluid, free-form designs in various shades of blue. They were influenced by both Korean and Chinese monochrome porcelain and less formal blue-andwhite wares from southern Chinese kilns\u2014the latter export wares that were made to conform to the aesthetic of the Japanese tea ceremony. Later Imari wares were consciously designed to cater to Western tastes and became much more colourful and regimented, at times achieving more access in Europe than their Chinese counterparts. Augustus II the Strong of Saxony (who on his death in 1733 owned 35,798 pieces of porcelain; the largest collection in Europe), B\u00f6ttger established a factory at Meissen, just outside Dresden, in 1710, and was soon producing large amounts of hard-paste porcelain. In the 1720s, the Meissen factory developed a new and extensive range of enamel colours, and the factory\u2019s painters excelled in fantastic depictions of life in an imagined Far East. These successes were soon followed by the founding of a second factory in Vienna by Claudius du Paquier, assisted by the former kiln master from Meissen, which began making hard-paste porcelain by about 1719. A number of other factories opened in Germany in the 1740s and \u201950s, often with workers from Meissen or Vienna who provided the necessary technical expertise. The discoveries in Meissen were followed by the establishment of major factories elsewhere in Europe. In Italy, where softpaste porcelain (an imitation, low-fired porcelain that lacked the ingredients found in hard-paste porcelain) had been made at the Medici workshops since the late sixteenth century, Francesco Vezzi established a porcelain factory in Venice that began producing hard-paste porcelain in significant numbers in 1720. Experiments by the Marchese Carlo Ginori led to the development of a hard-paste porcelain factory in Doccia, near Florence in 1737, which produced works inspired by delicate white wares from Dehua (fig. 7). Both men were assisted by workers from the Du Paquier factory, and Doccia porcelain from the 1740s sometimes features painted decoration that reflects the influence of Du Paquier porcelain\u2014demonstrating the atmosphere of technological and stylistic exchange that characterised the European ceramic industry of the eighteenth century. of the eighteenth century. Innovative and experimental new forms were always in development, and the factory looked to different sources of inspiration, such as Japanese lacquer (fig. 8). By the mid-1750s, it had overtaken the Meissen factory in terms of production and innovation. It remained at the forefront of European porcelain production for the rest of the century. Across the channel, English manufacturers struggled to discover the secrets of making porcelain without access to the necessary ingredients, and between the 1740s and 1760s were only able to develop formulae that created a range of soft-paste porcelains unsuitable for tableware. This changed after the discovery of kaolin clay in Cornwall in 1746 by an English chemist named William Cookworthy, who soon found even better-quality clay in St Stephen\u2019s, near St Austell. After two decades of experimentation, Cookworthy patented his recipe for making porcelain and established the Plymouth China factory in 1768\u2014the first in England to manufacture hard-paste porcelain. By the turn of the century, England had a flourishing porcelain industry, with factories in Derby, Worcester, Staffordshire, Liverpool and elsewhere. Primarily commercial ventures that operated without noble or royal financial support, they were run by entrepreneurs and artisans, and much of their output was aimed at a growing middle class. The European factories were so successful that eventually the demand for Chinese porcelain began to diminish, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the trade fell into serious decline. But centuries of genuine artistic exchange stimulated by the trade in porcelain had left an indelible mark on the arts of Europe. Chinese ceramics remain a potent source of design ideas for artists today, working in fields as diverse as architecture, interior design, theatre and painting. Ben Chiesa   \nAssistant Curator, University Museum and Art Gallery,   \nThe University of Hong Kong Kaolin was not discovered in France until the second half of the eighteenth century, and all French porcelain produced before 1770 was soft- rather than hard-paste. Both types were first made in factories which had previously produced the most common ceramic product of the time\u2014faience, a type of tin-glazed earthenware\u2014like those in Rouen and SaintCloud. Perhaps the most successful of these was at S\u00e8vres in the western part of Paris, which had moved from its former premises in Vincennes in 1756. With the financial backing of King Louis XV (r. 1715\u20131774), the S\u00e8vres factory soon came to dominate not only the French ceramic industry, but also the entirety of European ceramics for the second half Plate.

        "text": "Perhaps the first truly global commodity, blue-and-white porcelain reached a wider audience than any other type of Chinese ceramic. Sent to markets in Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea, India, the Middle East and even Africa, it inspired potters in major ceramic centres to produce elegant ceramics of their own design; from the rich turquoise fritwares of fifteenth-century Iznik, to elaborately panelled Japanese kraak wares from seventeenth century Arita. Blue-and-white porcelain was also the first to be collected in Europe in large numbers, sparking a craze for things Chinese in the sixteenth century that would last well into the nineteenth, as new generations of artists and collectors rediscovered and renewed the art form. The earliest surviving Chinese blue-and-white ceramics were made in the Tang period, when kilns in northern China dominated the production of both high-fired white stonewares and porcelains. A shared creation of China and the Islamic Middle East, they were decorated with cobalt blue imported from northeast Persia or the Arabian Peninsula, using decorative techniques invented by potters in Basra, Iraq to embellish tin-glazed earthenwares. These earthenwares were themselves developed in imitation of Chinese white wares, demonstrating the remarkable hybridity of early ceramic industries in Asia. Tang blue-and-white ceramics represented a brief period of experimentation that was not repeated until the fourteenth century, when strong familial, cultural and economic ties to the Islamic world and the stabilisation of overland trade routes under the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty opened new markets and made access to imported cobalt easier. Yuan imperial patronage turned the kilns of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province into the largest porcelain production centre in China. Combined with a cultural policy that promoted artistic exchange between different ethnic groups, this patronage created an atmosphere of experimentation that allowed new forms and styles to develop, including highly finished works intended for the court and less formal wares for the export market, transported along the silk road and from major ports like Canton and Quanzhou. The success of Yuan blue-and-whites laid the foundations for the dominance of the export industry in the Ming and Qing dynasties, when millions of ceramics were produced in the imperial kilns and private commercial enterprises. Tailored with specific designs for certain markets, they often found their way elsewhere. The Portuguese purchased blue-andwhite porcelain made for the Malay Peninsula in Malacca, and when the Dutch established a foothold in the Indonesian Archipelago in the first decades of the seventeenth century, they gained access to the important transhipment hub of Batavia ( Jakarta), from which over twelve million Chinese ceramics were shipped to Holland between 1607 and 1684. Not all of these were designed with European consumers in mind, and Dutch still-life oil paintings reveal that porcelains in shapes seemingly made for non-European customers were sold and used in Europe. Blue-and-white porcelain remained the most popular export form until the end of the seventeenth century, when growing European interest in wares decorated with coats of arms encouraged the use of polychrome enamels that allowed for more detailed, accurate depictions of heraldry. The Jingdezhen kilns, still the most important in China, responded to this demand and the trade in colourful porcelain supplanted blueand-white to become the defining aspect of Chinese export porcelain in the eighteenth century.",

The shape of the pot resembles Tang period tripod vessels used by scholars to clean brushes and add water to ink. Chinese blue-and-white ceramics from the Tang period were virtually unknown until shards recovered from the coastal city of Yangzhou in Jiangsu province in 1975 confirmed their existence. Most of these early blue-and-white wares were likely made at kilns in Gongxian (now Gongyi county) in Henan province, together with a number of dishes recovered in 1998 from the wreck of a ninth-century Arab dhow which sank near Belitung Island in Indonesia.

Highly prized by the upper echelons of Chinese society, they were popular exports to Southeast Asia, Korea, Japan, India and the Middle East, and have been recovered from excavations as far afield as Kenya. They were made in a variety of forms to suit different tastes: from monochrome, blue-and-white and overglaze painted examples, to elaborately gilded works in precious silver. The earliest surviving porcelain yuhuchun are monochrome wares that date to the Song dynasty. These early yuhuchun seem to have been particularly well received in Japan, where they were favoured by tea masters. They were also among the first Chinese porcelains to arrive in the West in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, presented as rare gifts to the ruling houses of Europe via intermediaries in the Middle East. Yuhuchun decorated with cobalt blue were not produced until the Yuan dynasty, when the reopening of overland trade routes between China and Central Asia allowed Chinese potters to import high-quality cobalt more easily. Made on a larger scale than earlier examples, blue-and-white yuhuchun were sometimes made in faceted shapes, reflecting different approaches in the Yuan dynasty to the properties of clay as an expressive medium. While Song yuhuchun were mostly thrown on the potter\u2019s wheel and allowed to grow naturally into shapes with minimal guidance from the potter\u2019s hands, Yuan examples make greater use of the plastic quality of the clay in modelling and moulding. They were often decorated with imagery inspired by designs found on objects from the Islamic world, such as the patterns resembling Islamic calligraphy on this bottle. 5. See a bronze bottle with incised chrysanthemum sprays in place of the panelled designs on this example, recovered from the Sinan shipwreck of 1323 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). 6.

Clearly viewed as an object of great value, it was once mounted as a ewer in silver-gilt for Ladislas the Great of Hungary (r. 1342\u20131382), who gave it to Charles III of Durazzo in 1381 on his ascent to the throne of Naples, and is depicted as such in a watercolour drawing by the French antiquarian Roger de Gaignieres, ca. 1713, now in the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris.

Europeans admired the exotic profiles of Chinese porcelains inspired by objects from the Middle East. After arriving in Europe, often via the Netherlands, tankards were sometimes mounted with silver-gilt covers and stands. Later on, seventeenth-century versions of these tankards from Arita were even made with pre-formed holes in the handles to facilitate the addition of mounts.

The compact, hard porcelain body is more grey than white, with a blue-tinged glaze that contains numerous bubbles. Bowls of this type were mass-produced at Jingdezhen in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century, a period marked by a sudden outflow of Chinese blueand-white ceramics to Southeast Asia. Several factors contributed to this flurry of activity, including a thriving commercial industry which had developed in response to reduced imperial porcelain production between 1435 and 1465, and the ensuing environment of economic and political stability during the reigns of the Chenghua and Hongzhi emperors. 9.

Characterised by thick porcelain filled with impurities decorated with simple designs, scholars originally called wares of this type \u2018Swatow\u2019, after an old Dutch transliteration of Shantou, a port in northern Guangdong province that was mistakenly believed to have been the port from which they were shipped. Excavations in the 1990s revealed several major kiln sites in Zhangzhou that produced these wares in the late sixteenth and midseventeenth centuries; they are generally now referred to as Zhangzhou wares. Valued as much as highly-finished Jingdezhen porcelain in parts of Southeast Asia, Zhangzhou wares were primarily made for export to the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. They were also desired by European traders for the high prices they commanded in the intra-Asian trade. They were made in a variety of shapes, though surviving examples from shipwrecks like the Witte Leeuw, a Dutch ship that sank in 1613 near St. Helena, suggest that large dishes, bowls, covered boxes, jars and small plates were the most popular forms. Similar bowls intended for Southeast Asia from this period have been found in shipwrecks off the coast of Indonesia and the Philippines, such as a nearly identical example recovered from a Chinese junk that sunk off the Lena Shoal ca. 1490\u20131500, now in the Ambassador and Mrs Charles Muller collection. They were also sent to Persia, where the honeycomb pattern was prominently used on fritware dishes made in Tabriz and other important cultural centres. 10. The term \u2018Swatow\u2019 was apparently introduced by antique dealers and collectors, but it is not clear when the use of the term started. Robert Hobson (1872\u20131941), former keeper of the Asian Department of the British Museum and author of one of the earliest and most important works on these objects, The Wares of  the Ming Dynasty (Hobson 1923), did not use the term \u2018Swatow\u2019, nor did officials of the Dutch East India Company, who instead referred to them as grof (\u2018coarse\u2019) wares.",

It is decorated with a scene in cobalt blue underglaze depicting a man with a shaved pate standing among pavilions and banana plant leaves. Wearing a water-proof cape, he may be a hunter or outdoorsman. The absence of reign marks and the lively, imprecise painting style are typical of non-imperial blue-and-white porcelain made in private kilns during the so-called \u2018transitional period\u2019 between the collapse of the Ming dynasty and the stabilisation of Qing rule. Its roughly potted body is covered in small flaws in the form of glaze bubbles, pinholes, frits and grit on the surface\u2014the result of poor glazing that failed to bond properly with the clay. Porcelains like this were particularly popular in Japan, where their imperfections were appreciated by practitioners of the tea ceremony, which celebrated an aesthetic of austerity, spontaneity and apparent artlessness known as wabi. By the early seventeenth-century substantial quantities of Chinese ceramics made with obvious surface flaws (described positively as mushikui, \u2018worm-eaten\u2019 in Japanese) began to be made specifically for this market. These wares, termed ko-sometsuke (\u2018old blue-and-white\u2019) by nineteenth-century Japanese connoisseurs, were produced in forms that included tea bowls, tea pots, water containers, vases, food trays and incense burners. Though ko-sometsuke do not appear to have been exported to the West (none have been recovered from the remains of seventeenth-century vessels carrying goods to Europe), they had a profound impact on the form and styles of later Japanese ceramics made in Arita. Arita wares competed with Chinese kilns in the seventeenth century for a share of the European market and inspired the development of innovative decorative designs that combined both Japanese and Chinese designs at various European ceramic factories, such as Worcester and Derby. 11. The transitional period in Chinese ceramic production is generally assumed to have started with the death of the Ming Wanli emperor in 1620, lasting until the appointment of Zang Yingxuan as director of the imperial factories of Jingdezhen in 1683, which represented a return to strict imperial control.",

        "text": "This immense ceramic is a jardini\u00e8re, made as a decorative display or water container for the gardens of a Chinese villa. The main pattern depicts awkward-looking twin lions with sharp claws playing with ornamental balls. A prominent inscription at the centre reads: Da Ming Jiajing Nian Zhi\u2014 \u2018Manufactured in the Reign of Jiajing of the Great Ming Dynasty\u2019. Because of their weight, large objects like this were particularly difficult to manufacture, often warping during the firing process. By some accounts, they required up to nine days to fire, with frequent misfires. The almost purple colour of the decoration is the result of mixing imported cobalt blue with local cobalt from Ruizhou, called shiziqing. A signature colour of Jiajing porcelains, it was generally only used on jardini\u00e8res reserved for the imperial court, noble families or high-ranking officials. Auspicious patterns like the twin lions sporting ornamental balls were popular during the reign of the Jiajing emperor, a result of his interest in Daoism, alchemy and Xiangrui (\u2018auspicious signs\u2019). The rest of the designs on the jardini\u00e8re are similarly loaded with symbolism: the cloud motifs are variations of the ruyi (\u2018wish-granting wand\u2019) design. The grouping of these images represents a common device in Chinese art: the use of homophones to create visual puns. For example, the words for \u2018lion\u2019 and \u2018things\u2019 are both pronounced shi in Chinese. The combination of twin lions and cloud patterns therefore refers to the blessing of shishi ruyi (\u2018wishes for all things will be granted\u2019). Europeans who acquired Chinese porcelain likely had little understanding of this complex visual language, but enjoyed the pleasing colour, exotic subject matter, minute detail and technical achievement of such objects. The unusual creatures and unfamiliar landscapes also undoubtedly contributed to a European vision of the East that found expression in fantastical art movements such as Chinoiserie and Japonisme.

        "text": "Standard shapes for kraak included bowls, cups and dishes, as well as more specifically Western forms like butter dishes, mustard pots, saltcellars and wine pots. Deep, un-rimmed bowls and dishes were probably based on earlier Chinese porcelain shapes, while Western forms required the use of pewter, wood or silver models, which Dutch East India Company agents in China ordered regularly. Kraak wares could be of low or extremely fine quality, the latter usually the result of orders made by private traders for special clients. Large plates or chargers were among the most expensive items in European inventories, while smaller examples like this plate from the Hatcher cargo (a Chinese junk that sank near Batavia in 1643) were more affordable. 12. While caracca is generally accepted as the root of kraak, other origins have also been proposed, such as the Dutch verb kraken, which means \u2018to break\u2019. Jingdezhen, China (Ming dynasty), Chongzhen period, 1628\u20131644 Porcelain with underglaze blue, diameter 23 cm Hong Kong Maritime Museum, HKMM2014.0010.0001 The border of decorative panels on this plate is a distinctive feature of thinlypotted porcelains called kraak ware that came to dominate the export trade in the seventeenth century. Mass produced from the late Wanli period for export within Asia as well as to Europe, kraak likely takes its name from the Dutch term for Portuguese merchant ships called caracca, which first brought these wares to the West. Early interest in kraak in the Netherlands was stimulated by the Dutch capture of two Portuguese carracks in 1602 and 1604, whose cargoes were filled with thousands of pieces of kraak ware that were later auctioned off. They were widely depicted in early seventeenth-century Dutch paintings, such as still lifes by Floris van Dijck (1575\u20131621) and Osias Beert (ca. 1580\u20131623).",

Imagery like this is common in Chinese art, much of it drawn from the bird-and-flower painting genre that developed in the Song dynasty, and which found later expression on ceramics and other materials. Associated with boldness, strength and heroism, the eagle shown on a rock may represent a hero standing alone, a subject known on a number of earlier sixteenth-century export wares made at the Zhangzhou kilns in Fujian for export to Southeast Asia. The central image is surrounded by a reserve panel pattern typical of kraak porcelain. Alternating panels contain lozenge-shaped frames with a variety of auspicious symbols, such as a double gourd (representative of good fortune), leaf (felicity), peach (immortality) and pomegranate (fertility). Above the lozenges are triangular fields showing animal faces. Unlike typical panelled borders found on kraak, each element is unique and none are repeated. Deep bowls with flattened rims were a characteristic export shape. Designed as soup bowls, the wide rim was intended to accommodate large metal spoons that were not used in China. Many examples were made for the Dutch market, often called klapmuts\u2014the Dutch word for fashionable seventeenth-century hats of the same shape. Klapmuts bowls appear extensively in Dutch East India Company shipping records, as well as in paintings, the earliest dating to 1601.",

It combines the panelled borders of kraak porcelain with loosely painted motifs in the transitional style. The border is divided into segments of floral decoration alternating with robed figures seated in rocky landscapes. They surround a central image of two figures in a garden filled with rockwork, foliage and cloud scrolls. Based on Chinese prototypes, the Dutch painter has simplified the design so much that the figures appear almost cartoon-like. Although Europeans failed to produce hard-paste porcelain until the eighteenth century, there were numerous attempts to make earthenware imitations from an early stage. The practice of coating buff-coloured pottery with clear lead glaze mixed with tin oxide to create a white surface was most likely introduced to Europe from the Islamic world via Moorish Spain. It was practiced at numerous centres, where it came to be known by different names\u2014Delft in Holland, delftware in England, faience in France and Germany and maiolica in Italy. Dutch examples painted with decoration imitating blue-and-white Chinese porcelains were first produced in Haarlem in North Holland, where potters from Flanders settled after the fall of Antwerp in 1585.",

The design in each quarter of the outer band is repeated and separated by floral bouquets, except for an area that was intentionally left blank so that it could be personalised to suit individual buyers. That space was painted with a coat of arms in red, orange and green enamels\u2014 probably the arms of a member of the Knights of Malta. The design sources for personalised details like this were specially commissioned drawings incorporating the arms and insignia of the client. The quest to duplicate Chinese porcelain was an obsession shared by many connoisseurs and entrepreneurs in Europe. Early successes in Florence commissioned by Grand Duke Francesco I de\u2019 Medici (r. 1574\u20131587) led to the production of a type of soft-paste porcelain made from white clay and ground glass around 1575. Italian potters also attempted to imitate Chinese porcelain by applying painted decoration to traditional low-fired earthenwares with a white tin glaze called maiolica. Italian maiolica production flourished from the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries and laid the foundations for other tin-glazed pottery traditions in Europe.",

Because of their rarity and cost, these early mounted porcelains were confined to royalty and a few aristocratic families, where they were used as attractive sideboards or displayed in kunstkammer (\u2018cabinets of curiosities\u2019 in German). After the Dutch and British East India companies entered the trade in Chinese ceramics in the seventeenth century, and porcelain became available to a growing middle-class, the practice of mounting these objects with precious metals continued as a means of demonstrating wealth and luxury. Their presence in numerous Dutch and Flemish still life paintings of the early seventeenth century attests to their popularity. Mounted porcelain took various forms, from small blue-and-white bowls and ewers to large celadon vases and pots. This bowl was made for export at Jingdezhen, with the mounts added later, probably in the Netherlands. The exterior features an openwork honeycomb and flower-head pattern, revealing a body decorated with underglaze blue floral sprays beneath. Double-walled objects with a pierced outer wall like this bowl are called linglong (\u2018devil\u2019s work\u2019) in China due to the time and effort it takes to produce them.

They were usually depicted with the head of a dragon, the body of a deer (but scaled), the hooves of a goat and the tail of a Buddhist \u2018lion-dog\u2019. The treatment of the banana plant to the right of the qilin is consistent with those found on other blue-and-white wares dated to the mid-seventeenth century, such as an almost identical plate from the Gerald Reitlinger collection of the Ashmolean Museum (acc. no. 1778.888), and a number of fragments in the Metropolitan Museum of Art that were recovered from the wreck of the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Maravillas, a Spanish treasure galleon sunk in 1656. The glazed base is incised with the four-character mark of yutang jiaqi (\u2018fine vessel for the jade hall\u2019). The Jade Hall, also known as Hanlin Academy, was an official bureau made up of scholars who attained the highest degrees essential for reaching office in dynastic China. Such marks appear to have been a symbol of status and were used only occasionally in the late Ming period. They became more fashionable in the Shunzhi era, before falling out of favour during the reign of the Kangxi emperor.

After use, they were rinsed and stored in the pot with their handle down so that the bundles of hair would keep their shape. They formed a significant proportion of the scholarly objects made at the imperial kilns during the Kangxi period, probably because of the emperor\u2019s interest in calligraphy. The literati valued beauty inspired by nature, a preference vividly reflected in the objects they displayed in their studios, whether in the choice of shapes, materials or decorative themes. Literati objects like brush pots occasionally made their way into European collections via other markets. They were often repurposed, and it was not unusual to find brush pots in Europe being used as flowerpots. Some may have been acquired in Southeast Asia, where objects made for the literati were imported and collected by overseas Chinese merchants who turned to scholarly pursuits in their spare time. Jingdezhen, China (Qing dynasty), Kangxi period, 1662\u20131722 Porcelain with underglaze blue, height 46.3 cm HKU.C.1964.0289 The shape of the vase is modelled after archaic bronze wine vessels called gu first produced in the Shang (ca. 1600\u20131050 BCE) and Zhou (ca. 1046\u2013256 BCE) dynasties. The round mid-section, distinct from the more angular mid-sections of the ancient gu, is a feature of late Shunzhi and early Kangxi vases. The basic forms of antiquarian objects like gu had been absorbed into the repertory of the Jingdezhen potters by the Kangxi period, and were used widely for a variety of purposes; however, the pairing of the shape with literati subject matter on this vase suggests that it was chosen deliberately to appeal to the scholarly class.

But few of the craftsmen who decorated these objects had ever been to China, and their imaginations resulted in landscapes, people and animals that audiences in China would have barely recognised, such as the pagodas and trees depicted with hatched and cross-hatched lines on this bowl. Combining Asian motifs with Western embellishments, the twisted handles with moulded leaf appliqu\u00e9s were inspired by contemporary rococo designs on ceramics and metalwares. The bowl is made of pearlware, a greyish earthenware with a blue-tinted glaze made in several English factories as a substitute for Chinese porcelain. mathrm{~x~}11.7$ Toshio Egawa",

Made by adding high concentrations of ironoxide (usually in the form of iron filings) to the glaze during the firing process, porcelain wares of this type were referred to as \u2018Batavian ware\u2019, after the major Dutch port in Indonesia through which they were shipped. A visitor to the Qing court, the French Jesuit priest Fran\u00e7ois Xavier d\u2019Entrecolles described porcelains of this type as tse-kin (\u2018golden brown\u2019) in letters sent to his superiors in 1712 and 1722. He observed that they were one of the main wares manufactured for the Qing court on a regular basis, and a recent invention\u2014though the long history of brown glazes in China suggests that he was referring specifically to technical processes used in the early eighteenth century rather than brown-glazed porcelain in general. These wares were particularly popular in the Netherlands, although significant quantities recovered from the foundered Swedish East Indiaman Gotheborg (sunk 1745) demonstrate that they were also exported to Northern Europe in large quantities. They were shipped to America after it entered the China trade in 1784, and the decoration was later revived in the early nineteenth century, primarily on wares intended for export to Southeast Asia. This bowl was recovered from the Nanking cargo, the wreck of a Dutch East India Company ship which left Canton in December 1751 with more than 230,000 pieces of porcelain, textiles and tea for the European market.",

Alongside a reign mark attributing its production to the forty-first year of the Qianlong emperor\u2019s reign, a carved inscription on the foot identifies its subject as cong wuyi Ruren\u2014 the wife of an imperial official. The rest of the text provides her name, Zou, and nickname (Jugu, \u2018lady of chrysanthemum\u2019) from which the dish presumably takes its shape. This is followed by a detailed account of her family background. Ruren was the title granted for the mothers and wives of imperial officials of the seventh rank and higher during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Traditional epitaphs were often carved on stones or ceramics. They described the experiences, merits and accomplishments of the deceased and were mostly reserved for imperial officials and their family members. The eulogy on this bowl associates Zou with many of the feminine virtues in dynastic China, such as the Confucian triad of obedience as a daughter, wife and mother. Both \u2018willow\u2019 and \u2018stay\u2019 are pronounced liu in Chinese, and the presence of the willow at the centre of the bowl was likely an expression of yearning for Zou from her family. mathrm{~X~}~27$ HKU.C.1991.0939 The extremely fine, evenly toned porcelains in this section were made in the kilns of Dehua in Fujian province, southern China. Fujian, a tea-growing region, attracted the attention of European merchants in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and many of these objects were brought back to Europe, where this type of white Dehua porcelain became known as blanc de Chine (French for \u2018white of China\u2019). They were also exported to Japan in large quantities. Dehua specialised in whitewares, the most highly prized were those with an ivory-coloured glaze. References in seventeenthcentury literary sources note that the translucent appearance of Dehua whitewares was the result of \u2018truly fine\u2019 porcelain stone that was dug by driving a shaft into the side of a nearby hill, from where the material was then pulled out with a rope. The earliest pieces of Dehua porcelain were made of this locally mined porcelain stone, with little or no clay, and were thinly potted. Unlike Jingdezhen, the Dehua kilns had no access to water transportation and until the arrival of foreign merchants most of its products were sold locally. The most common types of Dehua products were incense burners and Buddhist figures moulded and finished by hand. In China, these were usually placed on household altars and the latter were worshipped as devotional images. They were also brought to Europe as exotic curiosity items during the seventeenth century, where they were placed on tables and cabinets in the residences of aristocrats and wealthy people, or exhibited in \u2018porcelain rooms\u2019. By the eighteenth century, Europeans were familiar with Chinese polychrome ceramics. Dehua wares simply may have been seen as too plain by comparison, and many were gilded or enamelled in Europe to make them more attractive to customers. The Dehua kilns also produced objects tailored for the European market, including figures of Dutch men and women and Christian figures. These wares were closely copied at European porcelain factories, such as Meissen, Chantilly and Bow.",

Her body is dressed in loosely fitting robes that fall open at the chest, revealing a lotus-shaped pendant and leaving only her right foot uncovered. The head, slightly lowered, bears a jewelled crown placed on neatly arranged hair in a high chignon, all covered by a cowl. Moulded in different sections, the exterior is fully covered by a white glaze with a slightly blueish hue, leaving only the base rim and the interior uncovered. Guanyin, the bodhisattva of compassion, is one of the most popular Buddhist figures in China. She originated in India as the male bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, who was transformed after the introduction of Buddhism into China (through a process that is not well understood) into a female bodhisattva associated with the virtues of compassion and mercy. Guanyin was also worshipped as the patron of fishermen, and by women as a fertility goddess and \u2018bringer of sons\u2019. Early images of a cowled female bodhisattva, dating from the Song dynasty, have been found at the ancient Buddhist cave shrines of Maijishan (cave 165), Gansu province and Dazu (cave 136) in Chongqing. From the seventeenth century onwards, the porcelain kilns at Dehua were celebrated for their production of Buddhist models, amongst which Guanyin figures were prominent. They appear to have been the most popular figural subjects during the reign of the Wanli emperor through to the end of the Qing dynasty.

Traces of cold painted enamels (applied after the pottery had been both glazed and fired) reveal how red and black were used to embellish the lips, robes, hair and shoes of the figures. This was probably the work of a European enameller attempting to mimic the vivid colours of polychrome porcelains, which were increasingly popular in Europe in the eighteenth century. Figures such as this constituted an important part of the output at the Dehua kilns, and many made for export were based on scenes inspired by popular Dutch genre paintings.

Both decorative and functional, they expressed the sophistication and connoisseurship of their owners and were sometimes used in the composition of literary works and paintings. Their shapes, often inspired by the natural world, provided philosophical and moral inspiration to scholars through their symbolic content. The shape of this brush washer, for example, imitates lotus leaves, which are traditional symbols of purity in Chinese culture because they rise out of the mud to bloom. Leaf-shaped brush washers from Dehua appear to have inspired the production of small cups for sherbet and hot beverages in Europe. The first examples were made at Meissen in 1711 in red gr\u00e8s, but later hard-paste white porcelain wares with tin-glazes were produced across Europe. They were a speciality of the manufactory at Doccia, Italy, where notable examples were made from 1766 until the end of the eighteenth century.

They typically have a bulbous body, a neck which is used for holding the vessel and a spout. This example is incised with a scrolling floral pattern that was popular from the Tang dynasty onwards. Used in Southeast Asia from at least as early as the ninth century, they found less utility in China, and were instead made in porcelain from about the fourteenth century for markets in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, shipped from the ports of Quanzhou and Fuzhou. By the sixteenth century, they were carried farther afield to the Middle East, where Persian copies were made and sometimes adapted for use as waterpipes for smoking tobacco. They were also brought to Europe via Portuguese and Dutch traders in the seventeenth century, where they were used as curiosities and decorative items rather than as functional vessels. Substantial quantities were recovered from the Witte Leeuw (1613) and the Hatcher Cargo (1643)\u2014the remains of vessels carrying goods intended for Dutch-controlled Batavia, from where they would have been transported to other ships sailing for Europe.",

        "text": "The decoration of ceramics with colourful patterns in China started with sancai or \u2018three-colour\u2019 wares from the Tang period. During the late Ming and Qing dynasties, when the trade in porcelain between China and the West reached new heights, porcelains decorated in red, green and yellow with outlines of blackish cobalt or underglaze blue called wucai (\u2018five-colour\u2019) became the most widely produced polychrome wares. Depending on the prominence of certain colours, they came to be known in Europe by names such as famille verte (\u2018green family\u2019) and famille rose (\u2018rose family\u2019), after terms used\u00a0by the French Jesuit and\u00a0ceramic\u00a0collector Albert\u00a0Jacquemart\u00a0in 1873. Colours were added to porcelain by applying enamels (powdered glass mixed with pigments) to unglazed clay that had been through one firing or to glazed ceramics, sometimes with underglaze decoration in blue applied beforehand. The enamels were then fused to the surface through a second firing at a relatively low temperature of about $900^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . Major advancements in the production of polychrome porcelain were achieved in the early eighteenth century, driven by the support of the Kangxi emperor\u2014a patron of the arts who encouraged experimentation at the imperial kilns in Jingdezhen\u2014and by the arrival of European Jesuits at court, who brought with them knowledge of Western chemistry. These innovations included the use of a greater percentage of kaolin in the firing process, the subtle use of shading in new colours like pink and white, and changes to the composition and firing of glazes that led to the invention of complex hues like \u2018peachbloom\u2019 and \u2018oxblood red\u2019. Enamelled porcelain proved hugely successful in Europe, and large amounts were purchased by the Dutch and British East India companies in the seventeenth century. This trade was briefly interrupted when the Qing dynasty cut off porcelain exports from 1644 to 1684, at which point traders turned to the Arita kilns in Japan. The brightly coloured objects they purchased from there were popular enough that Chinese makers were forced to imitate Japanese styles when Chinese exports resumed. European manufactories later produced their own synthesised versions, incorporating stylistic features found on export ceramics from both countries. Facing strong competition from China and Japan, they developed a wide range of goods aimed at different classes, from fine ornamental pieces for the fashion-conscious, to simply decorated items for daily use. Enamelled porcelain tended to be more expensive than blueand-white porcelain, which could be produced in a single firing, and also tended to be more expensive. It was seen as particularly suitable for special commissions with personalised decoration, such as coats of arms, and could replicate designs better than blue-and-white porcelain. It was an interest in these armorial porcelains that drove much of the demand for enamelled porcelains in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Many different types of enamelled porcelain were also produced for export to parts of Asia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, where colourful and boldly patterned ceramics like Zhangzhou ware had been traded since the late Ming dynasty. Some were decorated with unique palettes and motifs not found on ceramics for other markets, such as the vividly contrasting colours and Hindu-Buddhist iconography of \u2018Bencharong\u2019 (derived from the Sanskrit word for \u2018fivecolour\u2019)  for the Siamese court, or the auspicious symbolism and bright pinks, greens and yellows of \u2018nyonya ware\u2019 made for Peranakan Chinese communities in the Straits Settlements.",

First developed during the reign of the Jiajing emperor, the production of wucai porcelain flourished in the Wanli period. These emperors commissioned a variety of porcelain objects decorated in this style, made in both the imperial kilns and private commercial enterprises. These plates, decorated on the interior with an imperial five-clawed dragon and marked on the base with the reign marks of the Wanli emperor, may be one such example. Despite the name, wucai porcelain could be decorated with fewer or more than five colours. Ming dynasty enamelling techniques allowed for some variety in tone, but gradations in colour and shading were limited. Innovations in the Kangxi period, such as the addition of opaque white (derived from lead arsenate) and transparent ruby enamel (from colloidal gold), led to the development of new variations of wucai, such as famille rose, which were highly prized in Europe.

The figure may be Kanaka Bharadvaja, a luohan (\u2018perfected being\u2019, rakan in Japanese), who in Buddhist art is commonly depicted with a book and a fly whisk. Called ko-akae (\u2018old red wares\u2019) in Japan, they are the colourful equivalents of ko-sometsuke dishes made in China in the seventeenth century for use in meals accompanying the Japanese tea ceremony. The plates feature characteristic surface flaws that tea practitioners found appealing, such as glaze bubbles and worn edges. But the protective brown enamel on the rims and greater regularity and delicacy of shape when compared to many ko-sometsuke speak to the complex aesthetic of the tea ceremony\u2014which was defined as much by individual practitioners as the sensibility of austerity, spontaneity and apparent artlessness promoted by influential masters like Sen no Rikyu (1522-1591). Though marked on the base with the marks of the Daoguang emperor, such wares were produced during a relatively brief period between the reigns of the Tianqi and Kangxi emperors. These reign marks were probably added later to increase the prestige of the objects or as a mark of respect. Other names for ko-akae include Tenkei akae, based on their prolific production during the reign of the Tianqi emperor (called Tenkei in Japanese), and Nankin akae, due to the Japanese belief that they were decorated in Nanjing. They were rarely exported to Europe, where more highly finished and thinly bodied polychrome ceramics were preferred. 13.

Wares decorated in several shades of green were particularly prized at the imperial court in Beijing. Their smooth, clear glazes and sophisticated decoration also found wide appeal in the courts of Europe in the seventeenth century. This bowl is decorated with a well-known design from that period, showing horses, flowers and auspicious emblems against a green background of swirling waves. The crests of the waves and some of the horses have been intentionally left without enamel, revealing the white body of the porcelain below. Porcelain with predominantly green and yellow designs came to be known as famille verte in the West in the late nineteenth century. Auction records and inventories of the time are littered with references to vases, figures and animals decorated in these colours, and the collector and academic Robert Hobson attested to their popularity in his early catalogues of Chinese ceramics in the British Museum. Major antiquarians of this era, including George Salting, Ernest Grandidier and Anthony de Rothschild, are known to have amassed significant quantities for their private collections.",

The overall decoration imitates Chinese famille verte porcelain, with stylised scroll and flower motifs mostly in green. The floral and scroll borders are arranged in a manner that seems inspired by kraak porcelain. The central figure is of European invention and represents a personification of abundance holding a richly filled cornucopia. Delft potters excelled at painting Western ceramic forms with Asian motifs. These luxury goods were produced in increasing numbers and competed with imported Chinese porcelains. Delftware inspired by Chinese originals persisted from about 1630 to the mid-eighteenth century, and since about 1640, Delft potters began using personal monograms and distinctive factory marks as trademarks to distinguish their work, like a blue $^{\\mathrm{~\\small~K~}}$ with a dot on the underside of this plate. Large flat plates like this one are also called \u2018chargers\u2019. They were often used as decorative accessories in well-appointed interiors. The lack of wear on this example suggests that it served an ornamental function. It may have been placed on top of a buffet or cabinet, by itself or with additional pieces of European and Asian ceramics, or brass, pewter or silver vessels.

The Chinese famille verte originals from the Kangxi reign feature brighter colours. This design first appeared on Worcester porcelain around 1770, and was only used to decorate dessert services. The design is called the Bishop Sumner pattern, possibly after one of two bishops named Sumner in the late eighteenth and nineteenth century, who may have owned a Worcester service with this pattern.

It was subsequently made by many other English factories in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. The name of this pattern, \u2018Dragon in Compartments\u2019, originated in the 1780s at the Chamberlain factory, where it was also simply called \u2018pattern number 75\u2019.

A third firing fixed gilded designs onto the surface of the blue ground. The complex three-stage decoration and firing of such objects made them luxurious and expensive export items. They were often decorated with figures and objects that European consumers found appealing, such as a slender Chinese lady depicted in several panels on the vase.

A cartographer and scholar, Luo\u2019s interest in topography and the Chinese landscape is well expressed in his poem, which was written in response to the Ode to the Red Cliffs by the Northern Song scholar Su Shi (1037\u20131101). Luo wrote that he visited the Red Cliffs five hundred years after Su Shi, and that the scenery was as beautiful as it was in the past. He described his attempts to retrace Su Shi\u2019s footsteps, and the sight of fishermen who came to sell fish in a silent landscape with lonely cranes flying above a river.

The powder blue porcelain vessels have an elegant, undulating profile. The elaborate gilded bronze mounts, which show dragons, were finely sculpted, cast and gilded in France, likely during the reign of Louis XV (1710\u20131774). Imported wares were often mounted with extravagant gilt-bronze settings, which adopted the stylistic vocabulary and fantastic forms of French rococo, while also making unfamiliar Chinese forms more useable in European interiors. Merchants called marchands-merciers, who specialised in marketing luxury objects, facilitated the addition of such mounts to porcelain, drawing on extensive networks of silversmiths, craftsmen and decorators. This pair of vessels demonstrates the high regard for fine Chinese porcelain at the European courts. In France, the earliest recorded Chinese (blue-and-white) ceramic object reached the court of Henry II (1519\u20131559) via Constantinople, a gift from Suleiman the Magnificent (1494\u20131566), Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Further gifts presented by the Siamese ambassador Phra Narai (1633\u2013 1688) to Louis XIV (1638\u20131715) in 1686, and objects imported by the French East India Company (since 1664) helped spread a fashion for such exotica. The intense blue of these Chinese jars may well have been an inspiration for the Sevres blue for which the French royal manufactory became so famous later in the eighteenth century.",

The name was first used by collectors in New York, Boston and Philadelphia in the 1930s to refer to their ostentatious detail and subject matter. Late export porcelain of this type was typically made, glazed and fired at Jingdezhen but decorated in Canton, from where it was shipped to Europe and America. These custard cups are part of a larger dinner service of dishes, plates, saucers, platters, tureens, bowls and cups suitable for a grand interior. Each object is decorated with a central scene in the famille rose palette showing different men and women among pavilions and mountainous landscapes. The scenes are surrounded by several painted and gilded borders with geometric and floral patterns, interrupted by small panels showing birds, flowers and landscapes in iron-red or sepia. This design has been referred to as the \u2018Rockefeller pattern\u2019 since 1979, due to its association with the famous Rockefeller family of New York. John D. Rockefeller, Jr (1874\u20131960), son and heir of the dynasty's founder, owned a dessert service with the pattern. Prior to being acquired by the Rockefellers, the service was owned and probably commissioned by Charles Stirling, a wealthy Scottish landowner involved in the China trade. Another service of the same design is known to have been ordered by John Roberts (1739\u20131810), a Director of the British East India Company, likely around 1805. The gradual dissemination of these services through inheritance and sale accounts for the presence of many individual pieces in different collections today. The famille rose palette used to paint the central scenes was developed in China during the late Kangxi period by Jesuit priests working with craftsmen at the Yangxindian (\u2018Hall of Mental Cultivation\u2019) within the Forbidden City. It is characterised by soft pinks and reds created by mixing ruby red (derived from colloidal gold) and opaque white enamel, which allowed for a great range of tones and shading. Its development in China was roughly contemporaneous with rose du barry enamels invented in France in the eighteenth century, named after the Comtesse du Barry, mistress to Louis XV (1710\u20131774) and a patron of the S\u00e8vres porcelain factory.",

        "text": "Like wucai, doucai (\u2018fitted-colour\u2019) porcelains are decorated with a combination of underglaze blue and overglaze enamels. However, while on wucai porcelain underglaze dark blue is applied in bold washes to complement strong overglaze colours, usually within outlines in red, brown or black, doucai porcelain features pale enamel washes with outlines in soft underglaze blue. Developed during the reign of the Xuande emperor, the technique was perfected in the Chenghua period. It has been used to great effect on this bowl to depict mandarin ducks in a lotus pond, framed by a band of stylised, possibly Sanskrit, characters on the rim. Since they were mistakenly thought to mate for life, pairs of mandarin ducks are an auspicious symbol for a happy marriage in China. When accompanied by lotuses, homophonous in Chinese with the word for harmony (he), they may also be interpreted as expressing the wish for many sons, and ceramics pairing the two motifs have their origins in the decorative arts of the Tang dynasty. Similar designs were used on Yuan dynasty blue-and-white dishes and enamelled ceramics from the Ming dynasty, as well as kraak wares made for export to Europe. They also appear to have been a popular adornment for Ming jardini\u00e8res, used as aquaria and to grow water plants.",

Established in 1600, the first English East India Company was named \u2018The Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies\u2019. Formed to pursue trade with maritime Southeast Asia, it eventually came to dominate half of the world\u2019s trade. In 1698, its name was changed to the Honourable East India Company and in 1709 a new coat of arms, shown on this plate, was adopted. Armorial porcelains like this plate were a major component of the global trade in porcelain for centuries, beginning with blue-and-white dishes made in Jingdezhen for export to Portugal in the 1540s. Britain was a major consumer of armorial porcelain from China, accounting for over half of the total amount of armorial porcelain produced before the entry of America into the China trade in 1784. By the eighteenth century, British porcelain manufactories were also producing such wares. This plate may have been part of a larger service ordered from the Spode factory by the East India Company in 1822 or 1823, for use in the company\u2019s factory in Canton. A banner on the reverse reads \u2018The London\u2019, after the ship which brought the ceramics to China in 1824. Its captain, John Barnet Sotherby, may have ordered several plates for his own use. The Spode factory developed \u2018stone china\u2019, a variety of tough earthenware, in 1813. It was one of many similar earthenwares made as substitutes for porcelain after the East India Company responded to the success of the European porcelain industry, and declining demand for Chinese export porcelain, by reducing large-scale imports in 1791.",

        "text": "Centuries before the flowering of blue-and-white wares in the fourteenth century, large kiln sites in northern and southern China were producing glazed porcelain and stoneware in various shades of blue, green and white, which were adorned with elegant incised decoration. Some of the most famous of these include qingbai (\u2018green-white\u2019), a translucent porcelain with a bluish-green glaze produced at kiln complexes in Jingdezhen and Jizhou, and celadon, a type of porcelain or stoneware with an olive-green glaze that takes its name from a character with a distinctive outfit in L\u2019Astr\u00e9e, a seventeenthcentury French comedy. Similar in colour to valuable jade, these ceramics were among the most highly regarded in China\u2014particularly celadon from the Longquan kilns in Lishui, Zhejiang province, which supplied the Southern Song court after the collapse of the northern dynasty in 1127. Today, some scholars prefer the term \u2018greenware\u2019 for these ceramics to avoid using arbitrary Western nomenclature. Chinese qingbai and celadon wares were also exported to East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Islamic world\u2014where the latter was thought to break or change colour if touched by poison. They were most eagerly collected in regions situated firmly within China\u2019s sphere of cultural and political influence, such as Japan. Song dynasty celadon shipped from Ningbo in Zhejiang province to Japan. During the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333), celadon became the favoured form of utensils and interior decoration for the Japanese tea ceremony, and formed part of a fashion for karamono (\u2018Chinese things\u2019), attested to by the thousands of shards recovered from historic sites and many intact examples preserved in major Japanese temples. In Korea, refined Chinese celadon pieces brought to the imperial court by official embassies in the Goryeo period (918\u20131392) were seen as the pinnacle of ceramic artistry. Local potters were soon making their own versions, combining stylistic elements drawn directly from Chinese wares as well as new designs articulated for Korean consumers. And in Mainland Southeast Asia, green-glazed ceramics reminiscent of celadon were among the first stonewares to be produced, using kiln technologies from China that allowed ceramics to be fired at much higher temperatures. They were made at a number of sites in Vietnam along the Red River Delta during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and most famously at Sawankhalok in the fifteenth century, when they formed one of the early Thai kingdom\u2019s most important export commodities. This absence was most likely the result of changing fashions in Asia. By the time Europe began direct trade with China in the sixteenth century, celadon wares had largely been supplanted in the domestic market by blue-and-white porcelain. Established kilns that had focused on celadon before the fourteenth century turned their attention to the production of blue-and-white wares\u2014although some\u2014such as the kilns in Longquan, Cizhou and Jizhou\u2014continued to produce celadon and other monochromatic ceramics in smaller quantities, and Song examples remained popular among collectors in later periods. 15. Qingbai is also referred to as yingqing (\u2018shadow green\u2019), although this name appears only to date from the eighteenth century. Other theories for the origin of celadon suggest that the name is a corruption of \u2018Saladin\u2019, the Ayyubid Sultan, who in 1171 sent forty pieces of the ceramic to the Sultan of Syria, or that it derives from the Sanskrit words sila and dhara, which mean \u2018green\u2019 and \u2018stone\u2019.",

The colour of their glazes ranged from a very thin and pale white to a pale bluegreen that is often associated with celadon. A related form of qingbai with iron oxide seemingly randomly spotted and splashed over vessels was one of the earliest experiments in underglaze decoration.

This saved space in the kiln by allowing for everted vessels to be stacked in a pile, and was essential for mass produced utilitarian and export wares. It also helped to evenly spread the weight of each vessel around the rim, preventing deformation and allowing for more thinly potted bodies. Vessels fired in this way had to be wiped free of glaze on the rim to prevent them from becoming attached to the kiln floor, resulting in a rough, unfinished appearance.

Few qingbai jars in these shapes are known, though ceramic liudou with other glazes were sometimes  produced at kilns in Yaozhou and Ganzhou, the latter including a notable example recovered from the Sinan wreck, a Chinese cargo vessel that sank off the Sinan coast of Korea in 1323 on a voyage to ports in Korea, Japan and presumably Southeast Asia. In the Song dynasty, educated men demonstrated their cultural refinement by collecting objects from the past and publishing catalogues illustrating historical jades and bronzes. Contemporary Song craftsmen responded to this behavior by reproducing antiquarian forms in other materials, often in the form of commissions for wealthy clients. New users adapted the functions of these objects to suit their needs. This jar was most likely used for burning incense or for offering food to deceased ancestors, rather than as an agricultural tool.",

Primarily intended for antiquarian collectors or commissioned by the imperial court, this later type of celadon evoked the taste and styles of earlier periods.

The interior of this bowl is finely incised with two long-tailed parrots, positioned as if chasing each other. The patterns were carved with a knife, a technique known as eumgak cheongja (\u2018incised celadon\u2019), which flourished in Korea during the twelfth century. The brown hue of the glaze is likely the result of poor control of oxygen levels during the firing process. On the base, three small spur marks are the remnants of sand, pebbles or shells commonly used to raise ceramic vessels off the kiln floor, so as to prevent their bases from picking up residue or being deformed.",

Unique to Korea, this technique involves etching the desired motifs onto a dry clay body and filling in the carved space with a black or white slip, after which the translucent glaze is applied, and the vessel is fired. It developed in the mid-twelfth century, possibly inspired by contemporary metalworking and lacquer techniques. Much of the symbolism used in Korean art was adapted from the Chinese decorative repertoire as a result of the close cultural ties between the two countries. Many designs used on celadon wares and other decorative objects are associated with Buddhism, Daoism or Confucianism, which at various times were supported by the ruling class and came to permeate social and religious life. The cranes on this bowl would have carried similar associations with cranes in China, which symbolise longevity. The swirling cloud patterns in the background were a common decorative backdrop used to supplement central motifs and are almost identical to patterns found on Goryeo embroidery.

There were two main centres of production: one in the capital, Sukhothai, and a larger complex in Sawankhalok (also called Si Satchanalai) to the north. The earliest celadons from these sites were probably made around 1400, with many examples recovered from the Nanyang and Longquan wrecks, which sunk in the South China Sea around 1380 and 1400 respectively. These wares appear to have been influenced by green-glazed ceramics introduced to China in the fourteenth century via maritime trade and Thai envoys sent to China, who brought celadon wares back with them after providing tribute to the Ming court\u2014although Thai tradition attributes the development of celadon to Chinese refugees who arrived in Thailand after the collapse of the Song dynasty in 1279. Demonstrating a range of Chinese, Khmer and Vietnamese influences, celadon wares from Sawankhalok are nevertheless distinctly Thai in their choice of motifs and shapes, with a characteristic soft green tone achieved by applying green glaze over a white slip. They became popular export items in the fifteenth century, as Thai kilns took advantage of disruptions to production in China to send their ceramics to the Indonesian Archipelago, Malay Peninsula and other parts of Southeast Asia. Sawankhalok celadon comprises a major part of the cargo of the mid-fifteenth century Royal Nanhai, the wreck of a Siamese junk heading for Java that was carrying over 20,000 ceramic items. They appear to have been the dominant form of Southeast Asian celadon until around 1488, when they were supplanted by Burmese examples.

It is typical of the high-quality celadon produced in northern Vietnam during the Tran dynasty (1225\u20131400). Like potters in Thailand during the so-called Ming gap, Vietnamese kilns along the banks of the Red River began exporting ceramics to Turkey, Egypt, Indonesia and Japan to fill the vacuum left by the trade with China from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries. The output of these kilns reflected contemporary stylistic changes in the Middle Kingdom, as the popularity of ivory- and celadon-glazed vessels soon yielded to ceramics with painted decoration in iron brown or cobalt blue.",
