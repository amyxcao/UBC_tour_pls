    "text": "Brush pots held brushes used by scribes for Chinese calligraphy. After use, they were rinsed and stored in the pot with their handle down so that the bundles of hair would keep their shape. They formed a significant proportion of the scholarly objects made at the imperial kilns during the Kangxi period, probably because of the emperor\u2019s interest in calligraphy. The literati valued beauty inspired by nature, a preference vividly reflected in the objects they displayed in their studios, whether in the choice of shapes, materials or decorative themes. Literati objects like brush pots occasionally made their way into European collections via other markets. They were often repurposed, and it was not unusual to find brush pots in Europe being used as flowerpots. Some may have been acquired in Southeast Asia, where objects made for the literati were imported and collected by overseas Chinese merchants who turned to scholarly pursuits in their spare time. Jingdezhen, China (Qing dynasty), Kangxi period, 1662\u20131722 Porcelain with underglaze blue, height 46.3 cm HKU.C.1964.0289 The shape of the vase is modelled after archaic bronze wine vessels called gu first produced in the Shang (ca. 1600\u20131050 BCE) and Zhou (ca. 1046\u2013256 BCE) dynasties. The round mid-section, distinct from the more angular mid-sections of the ancient gu, is a feature of late Shunzhi and early Kangxi vases. The basic forms of antiquarian objects like gu had been absorbed into the repertory of the Jingdezhen potters by the Kangxi period, and were used widely for a variety of purposes; however, the pairing of the shape with literati subject matter on this vase suggests that it was chosen deliberately to appeal to the scholarly class.

But few of the craftsmen who decorated these objects had ever been to China, and their imaginations resulted in landscapes, people and animals that audiences in China would have barely recognised, such as the pagodas and trees depicted with hatched and cross-hatched lines on this bowl.

    "text": "Adopting a technique used to manufacture Ding wares in northern China, qingbai bowls and dishes were often fired upside down in the kiln. This saved space in the kiln by allowing for everted vessels to be stacked in a pile, and was essential for mass produced utilitarian and export wares. It also helped to evenly spread the weight of each vessel around the rim, preventing deformation and allowing for more thinly potted bodies. Vessels fired in this way had to be wiped free of glaze on the rim to prevent them from becoming attached to the kiln floor, resulting in a rough, unfinished appearance. To avoid this, potters sometimes covered the unglazed area with copper or silver rims, as on this bowl. China (Southern Song dynasty), 1127\u20131279 Porcelain with white-green glaze, diameter 22 cm HKU.C.1989.0958 Qingbai wares were produced in a variety of forms for the domestic market, including utilitarian bowls, dishes and teapots for daily use and more elaborate figures and jars for burial.

    "text": "Perhaps the first truly global commodity, blue-and-white porcelain reached a wider audience than any other type of Chinese ceramic. Sent to markets in Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea, India, the Middle East and even Africa, it inspired potters in major ceramic centres to produce elegant ceramics of their own design; from the rich turquoise fritwares of fifteenth-century Iznik, to elaborately panelled Japanese kraak wares from seventeenth century Arita. Blue-and-white porcelain was also the first to be collected in Europe in large numbers, sparking a craze for things Chinese in the sixteenth century that would last well into the nineteenth, as new generations of artists and collectors rediscovered and renewed the art form. The earliest surviving Chinese blue-and-white ceramics were made in the Tang period, when kilns in northern China dominated the production of both high-fired white stonewares and porcelains. A shared creation of China and the Islamic Middle East, they were decorated with cobalt blue imported from northeast Persia or the Arabian Peninsula, using decorative techniques invented by potters in Basra, Iraq to embellish tin-glazed earthenwares. These earthenwares were themselves developed in imitation of Chinese white wares, demonstrating the remarkable hybridity of early ceramic industries in Asia. Tang blue-and-white ceramics represented a brief period of experimentation that was not repeated until the fourteenth century, when strong familial, cultural and economic ties to the Islamic world and the stabilisation of overland trade routes under the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty opened new markets and made access to imported cobalt easier. Yuan imperial patronage turned the kilns of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province into the largest porcelain production centre in China. Combined with a cultural policy that promoted artistic exchange between different ethnic groups, this patronage created an atmosphere of experimentation that allowed new forms and styles to develop, including highly finished works intended for the court and less formal wares for the export market, transported along the silk road and from major ports like Canton and Quanzhou. The success of Yuan blue-and-whites laid the foundations for the dominance of the export industry in the Ming and Qing dynasties, when millions of ceramics were produced in the imperial kilns and private commercial enterprises. Tailored with specific designs for certain markets, they often found their way elsewhere. The Portuguese purchased blue-andwhite porcelain made for the Malay Peninsula in Malacca, and when the Dutch established a foothold in the Indonesian Archipelago in the first decades of the seventeenth century, they gained access to the important transhipment hub of Batavia ( Jakarta), from which over twelve million Chinese ceramics were shipped to Holland between 1607 and 1684. Not all of these were designed with European consumers in mind, and Dutch still-life oil paintings reveal that porcelains in shapes seemingly made for non-European customers were sold and used in Europe. Blue-and-white porcelain remained the most popular export form until the end of the seventeenth century, when growing European interest in wares decorated with coats of arms encouraged the use of polychrome enamels that allowed for more detailed, accurate depictions of heraldry. The Jingdezhen kilns, still the most important in China, responded to this demand and the trade in colourful porcelain supplanted blueand-white to become the defining aspect of Chinese export porcelain in the eighteenth century.",

    "text": "Likely made for domestic use and worshipped on a small household altar, this figure represents the Chinese Guanyin, a bodhisattva (\u2018enlightened being\u2019), sitting on a rock in the \u2018royal ease\u2019 position. Her body is dressed in loosely fitting robes that fall open at the chest, revealing a lotus-shaped pendant and leaving only her right foot uncovered. The head, slightly lowered, bears a jewelled crown placed on neatly arranged hair in a high chignon, all covered by a cowl. Moulded in different sections, the exterior is fully covered by a white glaze with a slightly blueish hue, leaving only the base rim and the interior uncovered. Guanyin, the bodhisattva of compassion, is one of the most popular Buddhist figures in China. She originated in India as the male bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, who was transformed after the introduction of Buddhism into China (through a process that is not well understood) into a female bodhisattva associated with the virtues of compassion and mercy. Guanyin was also worshipped as the patron of fishermen, and by women as a fertility goddess and \u2018bringer of sons\u2019. Early images of a cowled female bodhisattva, dating from the Song dynasty, have been found at the ancient Buddhist cave shrines of Maijishan (cave 165), Gansu province and Dazu (cave 136) in Chongqing. From the seventeenth century onwards, the porcelain kilns at Dehua were celebrated for their production of Buddhist models, amongst which Guanyin figures were prominent. They appear to have been the most popular figural subjects during the reign of the Wanli emperor through to the end of the Qing dynasty.
