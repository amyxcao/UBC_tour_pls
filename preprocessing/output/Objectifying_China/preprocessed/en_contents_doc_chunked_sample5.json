    "text": "Other character marks and seal marks may have many different meanings: a wish for good luck, a date, a quality comparison, an owner or factory, or an indication for use in a specific setting. Individual potter's marks are rare on Jingdezhen porcelain, but they occur much more frequently on porcelain from Dehua. Marks are usually found on the bottom of a piece, sometimes on the edge or shoulder, or in the centre. Many different marks can be found on Chinese porcelain. The most prevalent in this catalogue are imperial marks that occur on pieces for the court and related institutions from the Ming dynasty onwards. They usually consist of six characters (sometimes four) in two rows that are read from right to left and from top to bottom, or in seal script within a square. The first two characters indicate the dynasty (for instance Da Ming, \u2018the great Ming dynasty\u2019). The next two give the reign name (nian hao) of the ruling emperor, for instance Jiajing, or Wanli. The last two characters mean \u2018made during the period of \u2019 (nian zhi). This tradition was continued during the Qing dynasty. Imperial Ming and Qing marks also occur on non\u2013imperial wares and even on export porcelain. The early modern era was marked by the extension of the Silk Road to Italy and by the beginning of the importation into Europe of Eastern goods in the fourteenth century. Porcelain from China\u2014the first country in the world to produce highfired, glazed ceramics\u2014was one of the most important elements of this trade, which in the sixteenth century had expanded to include vast quantities of tea, silk, lacquer, spices and opium. This catalogue and its accompanying exhibition tell the story of this trade, exploring how ceramics from different regions, particularly China and Europe, spread styles, forms and manufacturing technologies across the globe, and in the process dramatically altered the course of European and Asian art. While we place particular importance on early Ming dynasty blue-and-white porcelain pieces that reached the Ducal court of the Medicis in Florence, and early export goods in the Low Countries, our chronological display begins much earlier, with a rare Tang dynasty blue-and-white water pot and a Yuan dynasty bottle\u2014both from time periods that predate betterknown Ming production. These ceramics highlight the artistic quality and beauty of Chinese wares, as well as their influence, appreciation and imitation abroad. This international theme is further explored by presenting Ming and Qing dynasty objects that were made for local consumption in China, as well as for export alongside local responses to these wares in Europe, East Asia and Southeast Asia. In so doing, we move beyond the better-known influences of export to the West by including regional varieties of, for example, celadon ware in Korea and Thailand. We would like to thank our exhibition partners, the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Hong Kong Maritime Museum for their generous loans, and for their assistance in organising related public programming and publications. As with all UMAG exhibitions, our mission is to engage with audiences through the discussion of materials and techniques, as well as historic and cross-cultural exchanges. We express our gratitude to Robert Black College, The University of Hong Kong, for support of the exhibition on their 50th anniversary.

The shape of the pot resembles Tang period tripod vessels used by scholars to clean brushes and add water to ink. Chinese blue-and-white ceramics from the Tang period were virtually unknown until shards recovered from the coastal city of Yangzhou in Jiangsu province in 1975 confirmed their existence. Most of these early blue-and-white wares were likely made at kilns in Gongxian (now Gongyi county) in Henan province, together with a number of dishes recovered in 1998 from the wreck of a ninth-century Arab dhow which sank near Belitung Island in Indonesia.

    "text": "Exotic and highly valued, early porcelain in Europe was perceived in the same way as natural curiosities like ostrich eggs, serpentine and coconuts, and like those materials was sometimes ornamented with expensive mounts chosen to enhance its value. Because of their rarity and cost, these early mounted porcelains were confined to royalty and a few aristocratic families, where they were used as attractive sideboards or displayed in kunstkammer (\u2018cabinets of curiosities\u2019 in German). After the Dutch and British East India companies entered the trade in Chinese ceramics in the seventeenth century, and porcelain became available to a growing middle-class, the practice of mounting these objects with precious metals continued as a means of demonstrating wealth and luxury. Their presence in numerous Dutch and Flemish still life paintings of the early seventeenth century attests to their popularity. Mounted porcelain took various forms, from small blue-and-white bowls and ewers to large celadon vases and pots. This bowl was made for export at Jingdezhen, with the mounts added later, probably in the Netherlands. The exterior features an openwork honeycomb and flower-head pattern, revealing a body decorated with underglaze blue floral sprays beneath. Double-walled objects with a pierced outer wall like this bowl are called linglong (\u2018devil\u2019s work\u2019) in China due to the time and effort it takes to produce them.

Both decorative and functional, they expressed the sophistication and connoisseurship of their owners and were sometimes used in the composition of literary works and paintings. Their shapes, often inspired by the natural world, provided philosophical and moral inspiration to scholars through their symbolic content. The shape of this brush washer, for example, imitates lotus leaves, which are traditional symbols of purity in Chinese culture because they rise out of the mud to bloom. Leaf-shaped brush washers from Dehua appear to have inspired the production of small cups for sherbet and hot beverages in Europe. The first examples were made at Meissen in 1711 in red gr\u00e8s, but later hard-paste white porcelain wares with tin-glazes were produced across Europe. They were a speciality of the manufactory at Doccia, Italy, where notable examples were made from 1766 until the end of the eighteenth century.

Incredibly detailed, the designs demonstrate the sophisticated porcelain enamelling techniques developed during the reign of the Kangxi emperor. A great supporter of the arts, Kangxi initiated major efforts to rebuild the kilns at Jingdezhen, which had been destroyed in 1674 by Ming rebels. The emperor encouraged potters at the newly-rebuilt kilns to push technological limits, resulting in large, finely potted ceramics with complex polychrome designs. Common subjects for such objects include historical characters modelled after illustrations in woodblock-print plays and novels. Literati themes were also popular, such as the scene of scholars enjoying leisurely activities depicted on the brush pot, or the scholarly objects and antiques depicted in panels on the second vase.",

A cartographer and scholar, Luo\u2019s interest in topography and the Chinese landscape is well expressed in his poem, which was written in response to the Ode to the Red Cliffs by the Northern Song scholar Su Shi (1037\u20131101). Luo wrote that he visited the Red Cliffs five hundred years after Su Shi, and that the scenery was as beautiful as it was in the past. He described his attempts to retrace Su Shi\u2019s footsteps, and the sight of fishermen who came to sell fish in a silent landscape with lonely cranes flying above a river.

The name was first used by collectors in New York, Boston and Philadelphia in the 1930s to refer to their ostentatious detail and subject matter. Late export porcelain of this type was typically made, glazed and fired at Jingdezhen but decorated in Canton, from where it was shipped to Europe and America. These custard cups are part of a larger dinner service of dishes, plates, saucers, platters, tureens, bowls and cups suitable for a grand interior. Each object is decorated with a central scene in the famille rose palette showing different men and women among pavilions and mountainous landscapes. The scenes are surrounded by several painted and gilded borders with geometric and floral patterns, interrupted by small panels showing birds, flowers and landscapes in iron-red or sepia. This design has been referred to as the \u2018Rockefeller pattern\u2019 since 1979, due to its association with the famous Rockefeller family of New York. John D. Rockefeller, Jr (1874\u20131960), son and heir of the dynasty's founder, owned a dessert service with the pattern. Prior to being acquired by the Rockefellers, the service was owned and probably commissioned by Charles Stirling, a wealthy Scottish landowner involved in the China trade. Another service of the same design is known to have been ordered by John Roberts (1739\u20131810), a Director of the British East India Company, likely around 1805. The gradual dissemination of these services through inheritance and sale accounts for the presence of many individual pieces in different collections today. The famille rose palette used to paint the central scenes was developed in China during the late Kangxi period by Jesuit priests working with craftsmen at the Yangxindian (\u2018Hall of Mental Cultivation\u2019) within the Forbidden City. It is characterised by soft pinks and reds created by mixing ruby red (derived from colloidal gold) and opaque white enamel, which allowed for a great range of tones and shading. Its development in China was roughly contemporaneous with rose du barry enamels invented in France in the eighteenth century, named after the Comtesse du Barry, mistress to Louis XV (1710\u20131774) and a patron of the S\u00e8vres porcelain factory.",

In the Song dynasty, educated men demonstrated their cultural refinement by collecting objects from the past and publishing catalogues illustrating historical jades and bronzes. Contemporary Song craftsmen responded to this behavior by reproducing antiquarian forms in other materials, often in the form of commissions for wealthy clients.

It developed in the mid-twelfth century, possibly inspired by contemporary metalworking and lacquer techniques. Much of the symbolism used in Korean art was adapted from the Chinese decorative repertoire as a result of the close cultural ties between the two countries. Many designs used on celadon wares and other decorative objects are associated with Buddhism, Daoism or Confucianism, which at various times were supported by the ruling class and came to permeate social and religious life. The cranes on this bowl would have carried similar associations with cranes in China, which symbolise longevity.
