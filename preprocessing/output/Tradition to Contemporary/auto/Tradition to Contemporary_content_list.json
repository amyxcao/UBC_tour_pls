From the late Qing dynasty (1644–1911), Lingnan School painters migrated from Guangdong province to Hong Kong, influencing both young aspiring artists and collectors with their various styles. Infused with a mindset to innovate, local artists advanced the genre by creating ‘new ink’ and ‘splash ink’ styles that related to and sometimes challenged conventional practice. Subject matter, interpretation and application remained important, as did technique and the quality of the brush work that continues to distinguish the now iconic work of long-established and emerging masters.

Since initiating its publicly accessible collection in the 1950s, UMAG has been closely connected to the development of these painters and their work, and has actively documented the evolution of their artistic talents and the Hong Kong art scene.

As Xu Beihong wrote in one of his poems: “There are inheritors of the southern painting school, Mr Chao’s birds and flowers are true to life; autumn winds impede this old rider, while bright spring light shines to enviable depths.” Xu also praised Chao in a letter to Hu Shi: “Mr Chao is the first in contemporary China in terms of his birds and flowers, there are few in the world to match him.” Ye Shaobing’s bird-and-flower painting style was similar to Chao’s, using free brushstrokes and a ‘boneless’ (without outlines) style, along with coarse brushwork that gives his paintings a willfully unpolished look.

Chao’s work was painted in 1958, just as he was holding his first solo art exhibition.

He collaborated with Liu Haisu, the distinguished playwright Shih-i Hsiung (1902–1991) and other executive committee members to organise the Exhibition of Modern Chinese Painting, held at New Burlington Galleries in London from February 21 to March 25, 1935. An exhibition catalogue produced to accompany the exhibition includes an introduction by Liu Haisu on his views on the development, aesthetic principles and major schools of modern Chinese painting, including the Literary School, the Academic School, the Archaistic School and the Lingnan School. He stressed the importance of calligraphy as a way for modern Chinese painters to infuse personality, lyrical feeling and inner vision into their study of the old models. To him, the Literary School remained the most vital, while subtleties of handling and variations of brushwork were the most interesting features by which an educated Chinese might read the message of a painting.

Autumn leaves and the robes of a scholar in a pavilion stand out in bright red, in pleasing contrast with the muted colours of the silk background. In the distance, the silhouette of a mountain range appears in flat ink, applied using the ‘boneless’ technique (mogu) in which an ink wash is used directly without a delineating outline. In the inscription, Li Jian mentions his use of techniques developed in the Six Dynasties period (220–589 CE), particularly the boneless technique of Zhang Sengyou (479–?). Although no paintings by Zhang survive today, later Ming and Qing dynasty painters like Wen Zhengming (1470–1559) made copies of his work. The thatched cottage and figure in the foreground appear similar to those painted by Wen Zhengming, suggesting that Li Jian may have imitated Zhang Sengyou through Wen Zhengming. ",

Because he lived in a scenic area between the Dongqiao (‘East Firewood’) and Xiqiao (‘West Firewood’) mountains, he was also called ‘Erqiao’ (‘Two Firewoods’), and was known as one of the ‘Four Painters of Lingnan’, together with Zhang Jinfang (1747–1792), Huang Danshu (1757– 1808) and Lü Jian (1742–1813). Most of Li’s paintings were produced during trips between his hometown of Shunde and Guangzhou, when Li would sell his works and teach to earn a living.

In the background, the craggy surfaces of distant mountains are highlighted with distinctive textural strokes and horizontal dots called Mi-dots, named after the painters Mi Fu (1051–1107) and Mi Youran (1086–1165) who popularised their use.

It was painted in response to a request made by Guo Fang, a famous recluse, who wanted to document the blossoming, which more commonly occurs in spring.

Zhang’s admiration for Guo Fang is expressed in the inscription and complemented by colophons surrounding the painting by the scholar and seal carver Deng Erya (1884–1954) and other literati.

It started a two-year public debate with the Lingnan School in 1926 on how best to approach the modernisation of Chinese painting.6 Supporters of the Lingnan School promoted a new type of Chinese painting that synthesised Chinese and Western art and ancient and modern art. Although the two groups disagreed on the extent to which Eastern and Western techniques should be blended, both primarily sketched from life and incorporated contemporary scenes into their paintings. A seasoned traveller, Zhang spent time in many different locations, including Hong Kong. He often sketched outdoors with Huang Binhong (1865–1955) and other painters. Despite its unpopulated and remote nature, Shatin was the site of an important discussion between Huang, Zhang and others in 1935, which was documented in Huang Binhong on Painting (Binhong huayu lu).

Leung was heavily influenced by modern design principles and ‘hard-edge painting’, a term coined in 1959 to describe an approach to abstraction developed by California painters like Karl Benjamin (1925–2012) in the 1960s. In contrast to the free mixture of colours and shapes employed in abstract expressionism, hard-edge painting features separate, clearly delineated areas of colour of particular sharpness and clarity. As the title suggests, this geometric abstract painting primarily consists of shades of red. The composition is clearly divided into four major areas of deep colour by a rough grid. At the time it was painted, Leung was exploring techniques such as dyeing, crumpling and sewing layers of paper. Unlike typical hard-edge paintings, the fields in this work mix different colours, but the gridlines remain visible beneath. ",

After graduating, Leung taught design in the Swire School of Design at Hong Kong Polytechnic from 1975 to 1990, and founded the Hong Kong Chingying Institute of Visual Arts in 1980.

One of his larger works, it demonstrates Liu’s unique blending of Western and Chinese techniques. Largely self-taught, he was exposed to the former during a threemonth painting course in 1909 at the Institute of Stage Scenery in Shanghai, and during several visits to Japan in the late 1910s. His synthesis of the two, together with an emphasis on the observation of nature, set him apart from his contemporaries, who typically painted by imitating earlier works. ",

Instead of using schematic dots and finely textured strokes to form clusters of raindrops to model the mountains, Liew applied an ink wash to highlight the texture of the stone and moist ambience. Beneath the mountains, modern buildings are shown surrounded by tall trees and hills. Small but vividly painted in red, they hint at hidden pathways and people. Other motifs are treated in a more conventional manner, such as waterfalls and streams in the foreground. Together, these elements represent a traditional compositional device used in Song paintings to convey solemnity and harmony in the universe. The painting is inscribed with the first four stanzas of Mountain Temple at Lake Yong, a poem by the early Tang poet Zhang Daoji (667–730). It relays a lyrical vision of Buddhist temples amidst empty mountains and valleys, perhaps an expression of the artist’s religious and philosophical views on transcending materiality and seeking spiritual freedom.

Standing with its front leg lifted as if stepping forward, it has the slender build and the short, upright tail of horses painted during the Tang dynasty. Two of the horses are saddled and bridled, with a child and a woman riding them. While the child’s riding posture is stiff and its horse short-limbed and ungainly, the female rider and horse appear as one, galloping at full speed—probably a reference to contemporary racehorses.
