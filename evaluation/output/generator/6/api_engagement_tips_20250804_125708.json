    "Interactive Analysis: Split students into small groups and assign each group a specific object (e.g., Dehua scholar's porcelain, Chenghua blue-and-white bowls, or Goryeo celadon stoneware). Ask them to analyze the object based on material, technique, and cultural context. Provide prompts like: 'What does this object reveal about the values of the time?' and 'How might the design reflect the intended audience or use?'",
    "Design Your Own Porcelain: Provide students with paper templates of bowls or scholar's desk objects. Using colored pencils or markers, have them design their own porcelain piece inspired by the techniques discussed (e.g., celadon glaze or ivory-colored finishes). Encourage them to incorporate symbols or patterns that represent their personal interests or cultural identity.",
    "Vote and Critique: After the design activity, display all student designs and have the group vote for the 'Most Historically Inspired' and 'Most Innovative.' Facilitate a short group discussion where students critique each other's designs, focusing on cultural relevance and artistic technique."
