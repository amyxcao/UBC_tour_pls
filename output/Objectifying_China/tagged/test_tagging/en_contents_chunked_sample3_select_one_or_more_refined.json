The colours 'blue/cobalt' and 'white_porcelain/blanc_de_chine' are iconic for Ming and Qing ceramics. The purposes 'court,' 'imperial,' and 'export' are relevant due to the historical use of these ceramics in imperial settings and their export to Europe. The themes 'symbolism' and 'technique' are appropriate given the artistic and technical significance of these ceramics.

Bowls with floral patterns in the form of peonies or lotus flowers were among the most popular, and were made in vast numbers for the imperial court and for export to the Middle East, where they were preserved in royal Safavid, Mughal and Ottoman collections. Marked examples were strictly reserved for the use of the imperial household and as tributary gifts. Painted using different shades of blue to suggest volume, the decoration on this bowl depicts peonies with budding tendrils, with a border of stylised lotus scrolls on the interior. The naturalistic depiction of the floral motifs, open design and the rich colour of the cobalt (which is fired to a dark deepblue in some parts and pale blue in others), are typical features of Yongle era porcelain.",

The same form, but lacking a handle, is known in twelfth-, thirteenth- and fourteenthcentury Islamic metalwork, while examples with handles appear in Persian jade from about 1420. Chinese porcelain versions of these forms were made in the Yuan dynasty at the imperial kiln complex in Jingdezhen. Successful both domestically and as export items sent to the Middle East, they continued to be produced into the reigns of the Yongle and Xuande emperors. Clearly treasured possessions in successive dynasties, a similar tankard displayed on a  wooden stand is illustrated in the gu wan tu (\u2018pictures of ancient playthings\u2019) handscroll in the Victoria and Albert Museum; a form of pictorial inventory of the palace collections made in 1729 for the Yongzheng emperor. Europeans admired the exotic profiles of Chinese porcelains inspired by objects from the Middle East. After arriving in Europe, often via the Netherlands, tankards were sometimes mounted with silver-gilt covers and stands. Later on, seventeenth-century versions of these tankards from Arita were even made with pre-formed holes in the handles to facilitate the addition of mounts.

The name was first used by collectors in New York, Boston and Philadelphia in the 1930s to refer to their ostentatious detail and subject matter. Late export porcelain of this type was typically made, glazed and fired at Jingdezhen but decorated in Canton, from where it was shipped to Europe and America. These custard cups are part of a larger dinner service of dishes, plates, saucers, platters, tureens, bowls and cups suitable for a grand interior. Each object is decorated with a central scene in the famille rose palette showing different men and women among pavilions and mountainous landscapes. The scenes are surrounded by several painted and gilded borders with geometric and floral patterns, interrupted by small panels showing birds, flowers and landscapes in iron-red or sepia. This design has been referred to as the \u2018Rockefeller pattern\u2019 since 1979, due to its association with the famous Rockefeller family of New York. John D. Rockefeller, Jr (1874\u20131960), son and heir of the dynasty's founder, owned a dessert service with the pattern. Prior to being acquired by the Rockefellers, the service was owned and probably commissioned by Charles Stirling, a wealthy Scottish landowner involved in the China trade. Another service of the same design is known to have been ordered by John Roberts (1739\u20131810), a Director of the British East India Company, likely around 1805. The gradual dissemination of these services through inheritance and sale accounts for the presence of many individual pieces in different collections today. The famille rose palette used to paint the central scenes was developed in China during the late Kangxi period by Jesuit priests working with craftsmen at the Yangxindian (\u2018Hall of Mental Cultivation\u2019) within the Forbidden City. It is characterised by soft pinks and reds created by mixing ruby red (derived from colloidal gold) and opaque white enamel, which allowed for a great range of tones and shading. Its development in China was roughly contemporaneous with rose du barry enamels invented in France in the eighteenth century, named after the Comtesse du Barry, mistress to Louis XV (1710\u20131774) and a patron of the S\u00e8vres porcelain factory.",

However, while on wucai porcelain underglaze dark blue is applied in bold washes to complement strong overglaze colours, usually within outlines in red, brown or black, doucai porcelain features pale enamel washes with outlines in soft underglaze blue. Developed during the reign of the Xuande emperor, the technique was perfected in the Chenghua period. It has been used to great effect on this bowl to depict mandarin ducks in a lotus pond, framed by a band of stylised, possibly Sanskrit, characters on the rim. Since they were mistakenly thought to mate for life, pairs of mandarin ducks are an auspicious symbol for a happy marriage in China. When accompanied by lotuses, homophonous in Chinese with the word for harmony (he), they may also be interpreted as expressing the wish for many sons, and ceramics pairing the two motifs have their origins in the decorative arts of the Tang dynasty. Similar designs were used on Yuan dynasty blue-and-white dishes and enamelled ceramics from the Ming dynasty, as well as kraak wares made for export to Europe.

The interior of this bowl is finely incised with two long-tailed parrots, positioned as if chasing each other. The patterns were carved with a knife, a technique known as eumgak cheongja (\u2018incised celadon\u2019), which flourished in Korea during the twelfth century. The brown hue of the glaze is likely the result of poor control of oxygen levels during the firing process. On the base, three small spur marks are the remnants of sand, pebbles or shells commonly used to raise ceramic vessels off the kiln floor, so as to prevent their bases from picking up residue or being deformed.",

    "text": "Decorated with scrolling floral patterns and flying cranes among clouds, this bowl is an example of a type of celadon with inlaid designs called sanggam cheongja. Unique to Korea, this technique involves etching the desired motifs onto a dry clay body and filling in the carved space with a black or white slip, after which the translucent glaze is applied, and the vessel is fired. It developed in the mid-twelfth century, possibly inspired by contemporary metalworking and lacquer techniques. Much of the symbolism used in Korean art was adapted from the Chinese decorative repertoire as a result of the close cultural ties between the two countries. Many designs used on celadon wares and other decorative objects are associated with Buddhism, Daoism or Confucianism, which at various times were supported by the ruling class and came to permeate social and religious life. The cranes on this bowl would have carried similar associations with cranes in China, which symbolise longevity. The swirling cloud patterns in the background were a common decorative backdrop used to supplement central motifs and are almost identical to patterns found on Goryeo embroidery.

It is typical of the high-quality celadon produced in northern Vietnam during the Tran dynasty (1225\u20131400). Like potters in Thailand during the so-called Ming gap, Vietnamese kilns along the banks of the Red River began exporting ceramics to Turkey, Egypt, Indonesia and Japan to fill the vacuum left by the trade with China from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries. The output of these kilns reflected contemporary stylistic changes in the Middle Kingdom, as the popularity of ivory- and celadon-glazed vessels soon yielded to ceramics with painted decoration in iron brown or cobalt blue.",
