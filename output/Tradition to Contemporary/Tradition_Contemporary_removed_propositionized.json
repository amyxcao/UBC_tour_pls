Expressive calligraphic lines portray layers of trees and plants, with a hint of pink applied to a blossoming tree beside the main house. According to the inscription, it was painted in September, during a rare blossoming of peach trees at the home of Guo Fang in Shatin, Hong Kong. It was painted in response to a request made by Guo Fang, a famous recluse, who wanted to document the blossoming, which more commonly occurs in spring. The remote location and blossoming peach trees appear to be an allusion to the scholar-official Tao Yuanming (ca. 365–427), who was known for his reclusion in a small house in the countryside and for his celebrated essay admiration for Guo Fang is expressed in the inscription and complemented by colophons surrounding the painting by the scholar and seal carver Deng Erya (1884–1954) and other literati. Their words reveal deep respect and speak to a complex web of social obligations and networking in the literati community.",

A seasoned traveller, Zhang spent time in many different locations, including Hong Kong. He often sketched outdoors with Huang Binhong (1865–1955) and other painters.

Leung was heavily influenced by modern design principles and ‘hard-edge painting’, a term coined in 1959 to describe an approach to abstraction developed by California painters like Karl Benjamin (1925–2012) in the 1960s. In contrast to the free mixture of colours and shapes employed in abstract expressionism, hard-edge painting features separate, clearly delineated areas of colour of particular sharpness and clarity. As the title suggests, this geometric abstract painting primarily consists of shades of red. The composition is clearly divided into four major areas of deep colour by a rough grid. At the time it was painted, Leung was exploring techniques such as dyeing, crumpling and sewing layers of paper. Unlike typical hard-edge paintings, the fields in this work mix different colours, but the gridlines remain visible beneath.",

Instead of using schematic dots and finely textured strokes to form clusters of raindrops to model the mountains, Liew applied an ink wash to highlight the texture of the stone and moist ambience. Beneath the mountains, modern buildings are shown surrounded by tall trees and hills. Small but vividly painted in red, they hint at hidden pathways and people. Other motifs are treated in a more conventional manner, such as waterfalls and streams in the foreground. Together, these elements represent a traditional compositional device used in Song paintings to convey solemnity and harmony in the universe. The painting is inscribed with the first four stanzas of poem by the early Tang poet Zhang Daoji (667–730). It relays a lyrical vision of Buddhist temples amidst empty mountains and valleys, perhaps an expression of the artist’s religious and philosophical views on transcending materiality and seeking spiritual freedom.",

Fang Zhaoling made this painting in 1990—the Year of the Horse in the Chinese lunar calendar. The horse closest to the base of the painting is a war horse, surrounded by a backdrop of loosely-painted horseshoes in black ink. Standing with its front leg lifted as if stepping forward, it has the slender build and the short, upright tail of horses painted during the Tang dynasty. Two of the horses are saddled and bridled, with a child and a woman riding them. While the child’s riding posture is stiff and its horse short-limbed and ungainly, the female rider and horse appear as one, galloping at full speed—probably a reference to contemporary racehorses. Together they highlight Fang’s knowledge of the different types of horses used in historical Chinese paintings.",
