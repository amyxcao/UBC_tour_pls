Instead of using schematic dots and finely textured strokes to form clusters of raindrops to model the mountains, Liew applied an ink wash to highlight the texture of the stone and moist ambience. Beneath the mountains, modern buildings are shown surrounded by tall trees and hills. Small but vividly painted in red, they hint at hidden pathways and people. Other motifs are treated in a more conventional manner, such as waterfalls and streams in the foreground. Together, these elements represent a traditional compositional device used in Song paintings to convey solemnity and harmony in the universe. The painting is inscribed with the first four stanzas of poem by the early Tang poet Zhang Daoji (667–730). It relays a lyrical vision of Buddhist temples amidst empty mountains and valleys, perhaps an expression of the artist’s religious and philosophical views on transcending materiality and seeking spiritual freedom.",
