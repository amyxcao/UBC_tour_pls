    "    reference_contexts=[\"The golden pheasant on this kesi was woven with nearly twenty variously coloured wefts to illustrate its colourful plumage, including a golden crest and rump, purplered body and a long tail in orange and dark brown. The coloured variation for its body was achieved with the chanheqiang (‘blend propping’) technique. As one of the weaving techniques used to express the gradation of colours from dark to light, it is distinguished by the smooth and flexible overlapping of variations in colour. The blending of colour blocks often moves vertically from top to bottom, or bottom to top. In another technique known as guan (‘flinging’), two or more similarly coloured wefts are woven continuously according to the silhouette of patterns so as to achieve the gradation. The wefts of each block do not overlap and often appear to pile up layer upon layer. These were applied to imitate the colourful layers and texture of the wings’ feathers, from dark brown to brown and light brown.\"]\n",

Like Chinese porcelain, Meissen ware is hard-paste porcelain, which more closely duplicates the glassy surface of blanc de Chine than earlier European soft-paste porcelain. The moulded prunus branches on the tea bowl were a popular Dehua motif widely emulated on Western porcelain.

Oversized examples with extremely fine painting also had an additional ornamental function, and were occasionally used to decorate imperial palace grounds. They were popular export items to the Middle East and Southeast Asia in the fourteenth century, with comparable jars preserved in the Ardabil Shrine, Iran, and Wat Mahathat, a temple in Lamphun, Thailand. An inscription at the centre locates the production of this jar to Jingdezhen in the 24th year of the reign of the Jiajing emperor (1545)\\u2014although similar jars were imitated well into the nineteenth century. Blue-and-white guan jars evolved significantly over the course of the Yuan and Ming dynasties. The neck of this guan is significantly wider than most fourteenth-century examples, which also had lower shoulders, sometimes with small handles attached. The banded floral decoration is typical of the mid-Ming period, although vessels painted with peacocks\\u2014a symbol of beauty, power and the Ming court\\u2014are more unusual.
